<p>
	<b><a name="I.A">A. Introduction</a></b>
	<br>
	There are sure-fire plans to kill yourself, but they don't always 
factor in the character and feelings of the person carrying them out. 
This is why I have put some emphasis on contemplation and reflection in 
the Practical Guide to Suicide that I'm compiling: I think it is very 
important that the person him-/herself is taken into consideration, 
because any "sure-fire" plan can be disrupted by fear, uncertainty, or 
just plain self-deception.
</p>
<p>
	We need to devise scenarios for the typical experiences people are having when they are suicidal, like those who…
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		…are sick and dying anyway and want an easy way out that doesn't involve a lot of mobility
	</li>
	<li>
		…are depressed and can't find the motivation to go great distances (as to procure barbiturates like the ones <i>Final Exit</i> recommended such as  Phenobarbital);
	</li>
	<li>
		…are disgusted with life and want a way out that isn't too painful, messy or likely to fail;
	</li>
	<li>
		…want to die for any reason and are afraid of being discovered, seen 
as a coward, or judged as evil by those one loves and is obsessed with;
	</li>
	<li>
		…want to go out in a blaze of glory, making a strong statement against all one's enemies;
	</li>
	<li>
		…want revenge on some society, group or person, and want to use their suicide as a means of achieving this;
	</li>
	<li>
		…want to become an enigma or a media sensation, challenging the boundaries of narcissus.
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	I think that elaborate plans could be constructed for all of these 
conditions and desires, but certain combinations may be quite difficult 
to achieve (such as one who is depressed and lacking in energy and yet 
wants to go out in a way that would take some work).
</p>
<p>
	<b><a name="I.B">B. Making an Informed Decision</a></b><tt>
		<br>
		&nbsp;From: <a href="mailto:asm.ref.editor@gmail.com">ASM Ref Editor</a>
		<br>
		&nbsp;Date: Wed, 1 Mar 2000 13:21:59 -0800 (PST)
		<br>
	</tt>
</p>
<p>
	If you believe that you have a psychological imbalance that is causing 
your suicidal ideations, then I recommend that you seek medical help for
 this imbalance rather than merely reacting to it by taking an action 
you may regret. Certainly, before the age of 23 it is often quite 
difficult to obtain a coherent perspective on the world from which to 
make the important decision to end one's life.
</p>
<p>
	While I may counsel people about means to terminate life and even 
inform them of the most efficient means of achieving this, I am strongly
 opposed to preying on the weak-minded or disabled who haven't a grasp 
on their personal will sufficient to make an informed and mature 
decision on their own. Euthanasia (good death) is not coercive, nor is 
it merely concerned with the termination in question, providing also for
 the feasting on our kindred and the making kindred of the feast.
</p>
<p>
	<tt>&nbsp;&gt; I continuously want to kill myself. I have tried but have
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt; never been successful. I do not know what to do…</tt>
</p>
<p>
	Most medical (physical and psychological) conditions have been 
addressed with at least symptomatically-ameliorative, if not remedying, 
treatment plans that will likely contain a combination of physical, 
dietary, and medicinal prescriptions.
</p>
<p>
	If you do not feel that your needs are being met on the particular 
schedule you have been recommended, get additional opinions (consult 
whatever authorities you think are trustworthy) and experiment with 
alternatives. Research what is known about your condition, supplement 
your knowledge base so as to become more independent and able to make 
decisions without the need of people whom you may not know well. The 
internet is a valuable resource (with search engines, for example) to 
accomodate your needs in this regard. You can also seek out local 
reference librarians, as they will be of inestimable service.
</p>
<p>
	It is important to evaluate the following criteria:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		How capable are you of making an informed decision that will affect the quality of your life?
	</li>
	<li>
		How reliable is your emotional resolve?
	</li>
	<li>
		Are you being <i>driven</i> to certain actions, or are you definitely <i>choosing</i> them with careful deliberation and resolved composure?
	</li>
	<li>
		How much deliberation time is reasonable for you?
	</li>
</ol>
<p>
	<b><a name="I.C">C. The Elements of Suicide</a></b><tt>
		<br>
		From: <a href="mailto:asm.ref.editor@gmail.com">ASM Ref Editor</a>
		<br>
		Subject: Methods and Preparations
		<br>
		Date: June 19, 1999
		<br>
	</tt>
</p>
<p>
	<tt>&nbsp;&gt; …it's pretty easy to kill yourself, if you truly want to.</tt>
</p>
<p>
	Technically, yes.
</p>
<p>
	<tt>&nbsp;&gt; I don't see what the big deal about methods is unless you are
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt; trying to make it look like an accident in order to allow
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt; relatives to get insurance money or to spare them some shame or
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt; guilt.</tt>
</p>
<p>
	The main elements are:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<b>Access</b>—how easy it is to obtain the conditions and/or equipment;
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Efficacy</b>—how effectively it works;
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Speed</b>—how quickly the method is carried out;
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Painlessness</b>—so we don't have to suffer too much.
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	<u>Access</u> can be problematic for those with physical problems.
	<br>
	<u>Effectiveness</u> can be difficult to determine if we haven't yet separated fact from fiction.
	<br>
	<u>Quickness</u> intensifies the ramifications of the next element.
	<br>
	<u>Painlessness</u> is important to quite a few people and is sometimes
 expanded to include the retainment of the integrity of one's body for 
loved ones or in order to affect as few people as possible or represent 
an easier action to take—many of us are conditioned to 
self-preservation.
</p>
<p>
	<tt>&nbsp;&gt; …I am terminally ill,
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt; and was at a bad spot and thinking I might have to do
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt; myself in because of the pain. But I am on an upswing
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt; currently, and also have better pain medication, so I am
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt; (hopefully) not ready to go just yet.</tt>
</p>
<p>
	<u>Access</u>—doctors prescribe medication(s);
	<br>
	<u>Efficacy</u>—you can request more powerful drugs because they know 
you're going to be dying soon anyway and don't have to worry about the 
possibility of lawsuits;
	<br>
	<u>Painlessness</u>—meds suited to reduce pain may be acquired.
	<br>
	<u>Speed</u> might be a factor, as would <u>dosage</u>…
</p>
<p>
	The other important area of suicide discussion is <b>proper preparation.</b>
 Too often this is neglected, when in fact things like cardboard coffins
 are available for those who want to go green or low-cost, and good 
plans are in the process of being developed for those who know they are 
going to die (tying up loose ends, et cetera).
</p>
<p>
	<b><a name="I.D">D. The Empowerment of Accepting Death</a></b>
	<br>
	We can be caught between knowing that we want to die, taking steps to 
accomplish it, and really just wanting life to be different, trying to 
find some way to escape or hide from it. Attempting suicide can be a way
 of shuffling the deck. No matter how much we may decry the control 
exercised over us once we've failed an attempt, we are the ones who got 
us there. It is a means of changing the life we are leading (abandoning 
control, which a lot of us want to do but for which are afraid of the 
repercussions). This is in part why some people commit crimes—to return 
to a controlled environment where they won't have to face the stress of 
decision-making.
</p>
<p>
	Knowing that we can at any point terminate our lives can be a powerful 
incentive. "Okay, now I can do anything. If the heat gets to be too 
much, I can push 'eject, game over,' and I don't have to worry about the
 conditions I've created for myself." To many this is considered "weak, 
avoidance, cheating, sinful," etc., but that is just a human judgment 
intent on keeping us as their pawns, playing by <i>their</i> rules, condemned by <i>their</i>
 bogey gods, afraid to take the Final Power into their own hands and 
projecting this onto us as some sort of cosmic sin. After all, if they 
have to suffer in this shit-hole we're making of the world, we should be
 required to suffer it too, right? They'll say that we're a "sore loser"
 or a "spoiled-sport" (their game was ruined) if we don't remain inside 
their pitiful, finite game (cf. Carse, Watts) and submit to our 
position.
</p>
<p>
	They are condemned to Hell in a life they deserve, and one's power to 
end one's own life is like a "secret weapon." Remember those spy movies 
and stories? (We may pretend we're a spy.) There's always the "cyanide 
pill" if we're captured or enter into a situation which may compromise 
our values and goals. If we condition ourselves to ingest it (something 
that these stories <i>never</i> talk about, but the spies have to endure
 it to break anti-suicidal conditioning)—that is, to terminate our 
lives—then we're better equipped to attain anything we want, or to die 
after feeling that our efforts were thwarted. It is arguable that this 
is one of the strengths of certain Asian martial codes, such as <i>bushido,</i> which focus so intently on the death of the participant.
</p>
<p>
	If we're <b><i>really</i></b> creative, we may rig up a type of death 
which serves to accomplish something long in our wake, as is said of 
Jesus and Socrates.
</p>
<hr>
<big><b><a name="II">II. Preparations</a></b></big>
<p>
	<b><a name="II.A">A. Introduction</a></b>
	<br>
	When one is dedicated to the task, suicide will not be difficult to 
achieve at all. The major problem is internal, not external. Some degree
 of self-analysis, preparation for death, the reaction one will not 
witness but apparently cause, etc., is important since we are 
conditioned to regulate our behavior based on imagining the reaction 
others will feel in response to our choices.
</p>
<p>
	Other than deciding on the method of self-termination, the practical 
preparation for suicide includes accepting one's demise, how it will be 
effected, and one's role in the social world prior to that event.
</p>
<p>
	Deciding (or leaving undecided) the metaphysical issues inherent to the
 notion of suicide (such as how the cosmos may be structured, whether 
there are moral authorities who have forbidden the taking of your life, 
what happens to people when they die, whether it matters if someone has 
killed themselves as to the quality of any post-mortem experiences, 
etc.) is an important part of accepting the idea of effecting one's own 
death.
</p>
<p>
	Contemplating the likely responses to the type of suicide one has 
planned and the future development of the society in which one lives 
(i.e. how family and friends will react to the news of your choice to 
end your life, what, if any, repercussions there may be to the message 
your death may symbolize, etc.) is essential in the construction of a 
satisfactory suicide method and context.
</p>
<p>
	Discerning one's social role prior to suicide is immensely helpful in 
the precise delineation of the pre-termination itinerary. Whether this 
may include lying to one's friends and family (so as to avoid being 
bereft of autonomy and freedom in a misguided attempt to provide 
'help'), the resolution of administrative details (like arranging for 
payment of regular bills and any funerary expenses that will likely be 
incurred by your survivors, etc.), or a fierce and fiery 'Shooting Star'
 termination in which a huge mess is left to those whom you despise or 
have learned to disregard, knowing how to approach the world will put 
those destined for death one step ahead of those who may wish to see 
that a self-termination fails.
</p>
<p>
	<b><a name="II.B">B. Contemplating Death</a></b>
	<br>
	Fear of pain is an important reason to hesitate when contemplating 
self-termination. We don't want to become centers of pain—we want to 
terminate the pain (often psychological) that we may be feeling. The 
surity factor of practical methods is an important part of our 
consideration (which is why so much detail is included in the posts 
below evaluating methods, probably obvious to any who have seriously 
considered suicide before).
</p>
<p>
	But what is it about pain that we fear? To some extent this fear is 
entirely groundless and irrational. Are we sure we don't want to feel <i>any</i>
 pain at all, even for a moment when the grenade we've placed next to 
our head goes off? Flying through the air on the way to the ground, do 
we want to imagine the impact at high speed and the very short stimulus 
of every one of our nerves? Driving onward with our heads flying 
backwards after being lopped off by piano wire attached to the axle of a
 parked truck or the trunk of a large tree, do we want to feel the 
"awkwardness" of seeing the world suddenly go topsy-turvy, feeling an 
imaginary body and wondering where "we" are then?
</p>
<p>
	This is why experimenting with pain-play and getting over a dread fear 
of it can be valuable. We begin to understand that it is a <b>temporary</b>
 response to intense change (whether this be the change of decaying and 
dying as we age, or due to some possibly desired "catastrophe"). 
Eventually it stops being the obstacle it was and we can decide on 
suicide with a clear will.

	…the thing that kept me from doing it was not that I wanted to live but
 that I was just too fucking scared of dying. And it wasn't <i>being</i> dead that frightened me, it was the <i>dying</i>
 part. The trip from Here to There. It makes me shiver right now, 
thinking about that night. I'm just a coward, basically—this makes me 
wish I were dead, but at the same time it keeps me alive. Same old 
stuff. :(
</p>
<p>
	Maybe it was the method I chose that made it so difficult for me 
(hanging can be pretty gruesome if you don't do it right), but I can see
 where it might be the same with a shotgun. I suppose that when your 
conscious mind is aware that you're about to hit the Full Stop button, 
it's gonna fight pretty God-damned hard to keep you from doing so. The 
actual reasons are probably different for each individual.
</p>
<p>
	<tt>&nbsp;&gt;I have often thought that the reason people commit
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt;suicide is that they care too much about what
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt;other people think.</tt>
</p>
<p>
	Actually, that's one of the things that <i>keeps</i> me from doing it.

	…Most of us don't have the first inkling about what death includes, 
what it will be like, and a great number of humans hope to mystically 
circumvent this extinction-phase of our lives ("termination"). So we 
become members of cults which dream about afterlives and pretend that 
we're never going to die. the culture in which I live [US:CA] is 
pro-youth and anti-death.
</p>
<p>
	I prefer to learn from works of art like <i>Logan's Run</i> (though I don't like the fact that the society there was dominated and death wasn't optional <i>prior</i> to "degeneration") or <i>Zardoz</i>
 (which, while a low-budget cult film, has wonderful things to say about
 how fucked up people can get when we try to avoid natural processes and
 instead try to avoid the beauty of death and its results).

		&nbsp;&gt; As significant as the fact that the means are easy and
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt; painless is the fact that there is no stigma or shame
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt; attached to suicide, since it is accepted (generally
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt; speaking, even if someone would not want to lose a
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt; particular individual to suicide).</tt>
</p>
<p>
	This is an important premise to get across. Yet more than this should be the consideration of how death could be made <b><i>pleasurable!</i></b>
 What if death could be the ultimate experience a human being could 
engage? Pay a few thousand dollars and suddenly a whole circus of 
possibility opens up. Death during sex, at the height of euphoria; death
 while engaging all the nastiest (or alluring), most forbidden (or 
desired) pleasures of the world.
</p>
<p>
	If there is no future which may be ruined, why not engage that which 
would otherwise harm or destroy us simultaneously? All the most exciting
 things which we'd avoid due to their risk and deleterious future 
repercussions would become options!
</p>
<p>
	Recommended by a friend: cf. the book <i>Cause of Death,</i> which evaluates the exact processes of death without <i>faux</i> sensationalism.

</p>
<p>
	I don't have a good answer but here are some ideas that worked for me:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		Drugs, at least some of them;
	</li>
	<li>
		Wait till you can't handle the pain of being alive anymore and I'm sure you won't be asking yourself such questions;
	</li>
	<li>
		Some music;
	</li>
	<li>
		Making oneself deeply depressed.
	</li>
</ol>
<p>
	It took me several months to push myself over the edge (i.e. to feel 
like item 2) by using items 1, 3, and 4. I also isolated myself more or 
less completely from the outside world so I would have no one to think 
about when I was to do it. At some point i started thinking in circles 
and it wasn't long before I wasn't scared anymore about death itself. I 
didn't succeed in killing myself but at least now I'm not afraid to die 
anymore.
</p>
<p>
	This won't help getting rid of the fear of the afterlife but since I don't have such a problem I can't help there.

an English title (translated, though, it would be "Matilda's Last 
Summer"). but <i>Steppenwolf</i> (H. Hesse) and <i>Werther</i> (Goethe) have left a big impression.

		One of my favorites is a dark-comedy suicide flick, <i>The End,</i> 
with Burt Reynolds and Dom Delouise. It's hysterical! I particularlly 
enjoy the part where Burt swallows a handful of every kind of pill from 
his mom's medicine chest, with sour milk. He immediatly spews out the 
mess on a coffee table and remarks, "Looks like Walt Disney threw up."

 this book was published (in the sixteen-hundreds, I think, but I could

	Post-mortem fantasies (judgement by a deity, for example) are implants 
designed to prevent our being out of the control of the cultic group. 
There is no evidence for their reality. They have observable effects on 
human behavior (largely irrational), and can be countered by effective 
hypnotic techniques or a sufficiently long focus on counter-images or 
counter-indoctrinatory concepts.
</p>
<p>
	Suddenly "becoming" an atheist or materialist-scientist, studying the 
popular expressions of this culture, the Skeptics, or their like, can 
have tremendously liberating repercussions. We may even find that, 
unloading all this shit from a repressive religious regime, we are now 
equipped to face life for a few more years (hopefully in service to 
nonhuman species or at least to ourselves) without all that Guilt Crap.
</p>
<p>
	Also worthwhile is the intentional fantasizing of alternatives to the 
Nightmare Condemnation urged by these fanatics. I have, for example, 
imagined myself as being carried away by the shades as in the film 
"Ghost" (but without all the Orphic, Judeochristian horror), lofted on 
their shoulders in joy and revelry, a Child of the Darkness, carried 
down into the Wombful Underworld as Prince of the Daemons, crowned and 
conquering, a Hero for Terra. This has tremendously liberative 
counterbalances against the idiocy of the Bogey and His Punishment that 
the Western Book-Slaves have created in the minds of impressionable and 
perpetuated as a meme into the heart of existential angst.
</p>
<p>
	While I still don't believe in all this post-mortem fantasizing, being a
 good Buddhic Satanist, I do find that, having some other comparable 
fantasy material allows me to categorize it all more easily than 
accepting some sort of Pascal Rap about how much better the choice is 
that I must make <i>for</i> the Yosemite Sam God than opting (like Bugs Bunny, my hero) <i>against</i> this phantasm.
</p>
<p>
	I might just as well accept that I must make a choice <i>for</i> the God of Toasters or of Lemmings (here I come, ready or not, O' God of Lemming Suicides! Yippee!!).

</p>
<p>
	One of the more formidable obstacles to suicide is the desire to go on living.
</p>
<p>
	This would include attachment to loved ones, activities, places and/or 
entertainments which we would (presumably, some people have very weird 
ideas, like about the "afterlife") not wish to depart. I think lovers, 
children, sex, and wilderness are the most common attachments that keep 
people from ending their lives.
</p>
<p>
	Lovers will become increasingly difficult to obtain in an era of 
continued compartmentalization and disease-fear. Children will 
eventually be restricted to those with licenses. And the wilderness 
will, unless we take steps to bring these liberties into reality sooner 
than later, mostly be inaccessible or completely obliterated.
</p>
<p>
	Absent these factors, I think life will become drab and, outside the 
fantasy of media entertainment and the advertizers who will control 
those that view it, meaningless enough to inspire a great deal more to 
end their lives. Those with the capital will of course attempt to 
terraform other planets and recreate the relative Eden we have had until
 quite recently.
</p>
<p>
	<tt>&nbsp;&gt; people would accept suicide very casually. There
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt; would be TV commercials for franchised assisted-suicide-
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt; center chains (the "McDonald's of suicide"). (And
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt; then there are these fringe "anti-suicide cults"…)</tt>
</p>
<p>
	But what about the sensualist-death cults? You see, that is what I, in 
my queer CoE involvement, want to see more of: consensual human 
sacrifice, necrophilia, bestiality, cannibalism, perhaps <i>combining</i> all of these things in a religious ritual (could even be Christian).

	<tt>&nbsp;&gt;&gt; More likely: I'll check in to a motel, when I decide to
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt;&gt; check out. Let the motel staff and the police take care
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt;&gt; of finding the body, cleanup, etc., and just notify my
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt;&gt; family.</tt>
</p>
<p>
	<tt>&nbsp;&gt;&gt; The only drawback to that is that I think a
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt;&gt; suicide in a semi-public place like a motel is more
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt;&gt; likely to result in a newspaper story, which might be
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt;&gt; embarrassing to the family.
		<br>
	</tt>
</p>
<p>
	<tt>&nbsp;&gt; So why not go for a motel far, far away?</tt>
</p>
<p>
	I did plan on going at least into the next county, 40-50 miles away, so
 it probably wouldn't make the local news. If I'm really adamant about 
keeping out of the headlines, I guess I ought to plan on doing it on 
August 18, the day after Clinton gives his blow-by-blow account of his 
blows.

	Great plan—killing oneself in a foreign country is the same plan which I
 have now. And, if you die in a foreign country, without anything which 
can prove your identity, such as a passport, they authorities in said 
country will be very confused as to your place of origin, or even who 
you are—that is assuming they even find your body. And why don't you 
find someone near you who can send your already-written letter to your

	If you have attempted it before, others may suspect something is 
"wrong" due to any sort of sudden change in your attitude. Doctors 
and/or the media may have given them lists of "signs to look for that 
indicate impending suicide," like sudden resolve, openness, desire to 
let go of past issues with family, giving away one's possessions, etc.

	It is as important to us to know what will tip people off if we are 
intending suicide (or looking for people with whom to form a 
suicide-pact) as it is for those who want to thwart our wills once we 
have decided that death is the choice we desire.

<p>
	<tt>&nbsp;&gt;&gt; In <i>my</i> opinion, a <b>good</b> Note should include the following:
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt;&gt; —why someone took the bus [i.e., killed themselves]</tt>
</p>
<p>
	…I agree that, if someone actually thinks that they know why they ended
 their life (usually to terminate physical and/or mental pain or 
depression), then it may be important to include this in a suicide note.
</p>
<p>
	<tt>&nbsp;&gt; The second question they ask is, "Why didn't
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt; s/he tell us before?" So, tell them [in the suicide note]!</tt>
</p>
<p>
	Alright, I can see that this <i>might</i> be valuable, as long as one 
feels a need to conceal one's activities (rather than to responsibly end
 one's life by terminating/resolving all relationships). Again, it 
really depends on why one is killing oneself. If this is done to escape 
pain, then the objection ought be raised: why didn't you take steps to 
ameliorate that pain through the ingestion of drugs or subjection to 
psychotherapy to "fix the problem"? If it is done in order to reduce the
 human impact upon a beleaguered planet, then there is no need to wait 
until death to explain the importance of suicide or why one might engage
 it. Euthanasia (whether assisted or undertaken by an individual) ought 
to be the birthright of all informed adults.
</p>
<p>
	<tt>&nbsp;&gt;&gt;&gt; …what other solution one has tried before the final one
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt;&gt;
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt;&gt; unnecessary, but possibly helpful to others.
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt;
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt; And [it] shows… that it was an informed decision.</tt>
</p>
<p>
	Not necessarily, since there are always objections to terminating life 
based on the held-out hope that "there may be a cure someday." This is 
contrary to the notion that a person ought to have the right to 
terminate their life whenever they want in a dignified manner, and with 
assistance from the latest technologies.
</p>
<p>
	<tt>&nbsp;&gt;&gt;&gt; …why this was the best solution/[decision]</tt>
</p>
<p>
	Superfluous excepting out of compassion.
</p>
<p>
	If one is intending to end one's life, for reasons which do not involve
 other people, or one wishes to strike back at those who were unkind to 
oneself in life, then either refraining from any kind of suicide note or
 writing something very hostile will have an entirely different effect 
upon the reader(s). If one decides to end one's life, this should be 
sufficient for those who respect who and what we are and our ability to 
make decisions about that which it is only our business to decide 
(whether we live or die; notable exceptions for dependents, but these 
can be provided arrangements in a will).
</p>
<p>
	<tt>&nbsp;&gt; My six points for a <b>good</b> note are inspirations
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt; for a note to reduce the pain of loved ones.</tt>
</p>
<p>
	This may or may <i>not</i> be a desired activity…
</p>
<p>
	<tt>&nbsp;&gt; Other motivations need other points.</tt>
</p>
<p>
	Revenge, martyrdom, catalyst of species consciousness. Suicide notes 
can be written for a variety of reasons, only part of which includes a 
clear communication of where we are and what we're up to. They can also 
be made into a political expressions, final stabs of revenge from the 
grave at our enemies, a puzzle for those with way too many calories, 
etc., etc.

	Suicide notes don't create problems. The problems are endemic to the 
society itself and its sickness about death. However, taking into 
account the idiocy of society today, and what ramifications may come 
from certain spins on suicide notes, can be quite important (vengeance 
from the grave, for example, or giving your family a break for being 
"normal").
</p>
<p>
	Many people take notes as communications rather than last words in 
reflection of what one knows one is leaving (like a review of a film one
 has just seen), or rather than poetry (unless obviously so, which I 
think would be a perfect type of suicide note).
</p>
<p>
	If we can't say these things to people when alive, is this part of the 
reason that we feel so suicidal? If so, then we deserve to say them as 
we launch ourselves into the Realm of Death.
</p>

</p>
<p>
	<b>The Advantages and Disadvantages of Joining a Suicide Pact</b>
	<br>
	A suicide pact is, generally, the agreement of a group of people who, 
having discovered mutual interests in terminating their lives, agree to 
secrecy about a particular (often future) event at which all those bound
 by the pact will die.
</p>
<p>
	For those without the willpower or interest in solitary death, the pact
 offers a kind of community of self-destruction which serves to both 
support one's goals and make more likely an attention to detail. Given 
the depression which sometimes accompanies suicidal tendencies, it is 
helpful at times to have comrades in word and deed to bolster one's 
spirit and encourage the Final Act.
</p>
<p>
	Enthusiasm can be an important element in a successful suicide. Apathy 
or depression can lead to oversight, error, and accidental self-betrayal
 (e.g., a particular remark might give relatives the idea you won't be 
around for future family events and they might start to grill you about 
why this is the case). With group incentive, not only is there an 
addition of <u>duty</u> and <u>loyalty</u> to the equation, in that 
others are counting on you to help make their exit from life coincident 
with their desires, but the pooled resources of the group can overcome 
the limitations of any single individual (e.g., someone good with guns 
shoots everyone else properly before turning the gun on himself; someone
 without a lot of money can be given pharmaceuticals that all in a group
 are taking).
</p>
<p>
	One of the most important detriments of a pact as compared to solitary 
suicide is that the more people involved with it the more possible it 
will be that someone will betray the group and inform authorities of the
 pact and its details. For this reason sophisticated methods must 
sometimes be devised so as to preserve ambiguity of details and preserve
 the integrity of those involved until the date and location of the 
suicide party are determined and revealed.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Pacts and Physical Methods</b>
	<br>
	Pacts can assist in any method by virtue of their participatory 
character. It is easier to do challenging things in a group than it is 
to do them alone. Knowing that one is not utterly alone at death can be a
 comfort.
</p>
<p>
	With regard to particular methods, again, those which require 
particular skill, such as a familiarity with weapons, chemicals (e.g., 
pharmaceuticals), injection devices, constructed suicide devices, or the
 like, can be assisted by the pact in that coverage by at least one 
individual who is a part of it makes the method possible to all.
</p>
<p>
	A pact can also assist in circumstances where the context must be 
arranged (such as a large weight tied to the ankles) and this context 
may be frightening for the person themself to coordinate. Arranged (and 
consensual) killing of another may be easier to handle than 
self-termination. A single individual with the courage, for example, 
could bind, gag, and blindfold all others present, and set a shotgun 
pointed at the proper angle before each, triggered to shoot all pact 
members simultaneously and end their lives. Perhaps the triggering 
person would choose to die via the <a href="#III.C.7.b.iii">Death-By-Police</a> method after calling 911, or be killed by the same triggering device (e.g. a bomb).
</p>
<p>
	Gas and poison deaths can be facilitated by pact-making. A "monitor" 
can be appointed by the group to make sure that everyone dies 
comfortably, s/he being the last to go.
</p>
<p>
	One of the detriments of pact-making methods is that they are not 
foolproof. Deception, for example, is a real possibility, from the 
scenario where a participant is actually a spy trying to thwart the 
group plan to the thief and murderer who wishes to kill the individuals 
so that s/he can plunder their unguarded estate.
</p>
<p>
	One method to prevent against such problems is to recruit pact members 
only from within attuned societal organizations. Groups like Heaven's 
Gate, the Church of Euthanasia, or the Voluntary Human Extinction 
Movement would be the most likely to be trustworthy. Having values 
and/or beliefs in common is a good indicator of reliability.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Other Aspects</b>
	<br>
	It has been suggested that a pact group might be valuable as a kind of 
therapeutic resource. I recommend against this strongly, since as long 
as there are contrasting opinions which pertain to the subject of 
suicide this is likely to undermine the determination of the 
participants in ending their lives, and the <i>purpose</i> of the pact 
is to see this to its desired end. For this reason, it is probably best 
to limit pact group interaction to the preparation for, and execution 
of, the intended group suicide.

	My name is Barry Norris. I would like to offer my services to any 
member of this group. With prior arrangement, I will travel to your home
 or location of choice and using your desired method I will kill you. I 
am prepared to use any agreed evil force to end your life on this earth.
 I promise to take you from your life and cast you away into the 
unknown. Your soul will leave your body at my hands.
</p>
<p>
	The vivid terms come with some apology but in no other way could I impress on you the nature of my services.
</p>
<p>
	Should you need it, I can offer you an additional facility whereby I "dress the death." <i>Exempli Gratia,</i> the scene is disguised in the form of a burglary or car accident should you wish to spare the feelings of family/friends.
</p>
<p>
	When, having carefully considered all the options, you are fully minded
 to take advantage of my help, please feel truly welcome to contact me.

<p>
	I don't know which one of you peeps have money but, the hired hitman 
method is pretty cool. It's expensive, and you have to be careful about 
cops, because they often pose as hitmen but even if you do get a cop, 
s/he would be at odds with charging with you. Fuck 'em—I mean we're our <i>own</i>
 clients. No judge or jury would be able to figure out what to do. If 
you do manage to hire somebody, you get a rush every time you walk out 
of the house, and walking down the street you wonder when it's going to 
happen. This method is far more interesting than that boring 
self-poisoning crap, or car-exhaust shit.

<p>
	<b><a name="II.H">Making it Look Like an Accident</a></b>
	<br>
	Making one's self-termination look like an accident in order to 
preserve insurance awards or maintain an image to family or others can 
be a tricky business. One's lifestyle and geographical location can 
contribute considerably to the options which are available. Add to this 
one's condition and the limits to one's ability and willingness to 
deceive one's loved ones, and the complexities can seem insurmountable.
</p>
<p>
	The most important element to foster is a proven record of intentional 
survival. "Accidents" can happen even to those who may have previously 
been "merely crying out for help" in their self-destructive or risky 
behaviors. Do not eliminate the condition of surprise should you wish 
your motivations to be above suspicion.
</p>
<p>
	Responsible and thorough suicides who want to make it look like an 
accident will study the symptoms of suicidal or depressed individuals. 
Introductory files such as those for helping and encouraging 
self-destructive behavior can prove invaluable (an example of the latter
 may be found <a href="http://www.satanservice.org/coe/suicide/faq.encouraging">here</a>,
 but it is by no means a complete study) in the identification and 
elimination of evidence to support your true motives. Familiarity with 
reputable mystery writers, and their works in prose or film (e.g., <i>Double Indemnity,</i>
 et al), can be helpful supplementary research, as can a small foray 
into 'zines or more substantial publications which cater to the more 
abstruse technical details of mysteries or true crime dramas (for 
example, check out the newsgroups <a href="news:rec.arts.mystery">rec.arts.mystery</a>, <a href="news:alt.crime">alt.crime</a>, <a href="news:alt.true.crime">alt.true.crime</a> or <a href="news:alt.true-crime">alt.true-crime</a>, to name a few, and look for "murder (of oneself) that is intended to look like an accident in order to avoid detection").
</p>
<p>
	Certainly classic indications include a change in ordinary social 
behaviors, giving away one's possessions, a fascination with the event 
or philosophic relevance of death or suicide, and a sudden increase in 
risk-taking behaviors.
</p>
<p>
	The technical aspects of the accident are all the more important. 
Intentionality should somehow be ruled out through sabotage or 
isolation. Sabotage should be either unable to be traced or unlikely to 
be investigated, whereas isolation (e.g., being buried in an avalanche 
while skiing) should not be considered "out-of-the'ordinary behavior" 
for the the person committing suicide, lest it draw unnecessary and 
unwanted attention.
</p>
<p>
	Pre-planning is always helpful, but not always possible if the reason 
for suicide is impending terminal illness or some incredible physical or
 psychic pain. Even quite peculiar deaths can be arranged, given a 
planned transition to interest in sports or events that take place in 
risky areas in which an accident is more likely.
</p>
<p>
	Catastrophic damage is usually a better means of self-termination than 
some kind of overdose or poison, but certain physical conditions and 
their prescriptions can lend themselves to "accidental 
over-consumption." The problem with this latter method is the range of 
physical conditions which may result if the substances or dosages are 
insufficient to do the job properly [see <a href="#LD-50MLD"><b>below</b></a>]. Damage can be a more reliable termination if one has the courage and intelligence to pull it off.
</p>
<p>
	A specific method valuable to consider would be a fall from a great 
height, especially when surrounded by hunks of steel, massive 
projectiles, and moving at high speed. If flying an airplane is a hobby,
 for example, then diving into the side of a mountain in a storm could 
be an easy out. Many people drive automobiles, and these can easily be 
aimed off of very high precipices in canyonlands and mountainous regions
 into gorges of such impact as to render survival unimaginable.
</p>
<p>
	An examination of "accident statistics" in a reference section of a 
library would surely yield other possible options. Of less reliable—but 
likely unsurvivable—value would be "slipping" and falling in front of 
some large moving vehicle such as a truck or train, though one may wish 
to consider the drivers of such vehicles, and one's impact upon their 
lives.
</p>
<p>
	Other types of "accidental" death would be the contraction of a fatal 
disease. Taking up the hobby of world travel (especially to backwaters 
and some of the few tropical regions) could quite possibly net the 
adventurer some virus, bacteria, or parasite that will do the job.
</p>
<p>
	Developing personal hobbies such as explosives (like making and testing
 pyrotechnics, the collection of warfare equipment, such as grenades, or
 chemicals, such as nitroglycerine, or fulminate of mercury) can make 
one's exit a quick and relatively painless experience, while 
simultaneously, if fostered over the course of several years, including a
 convincing cover for one's self-destructive intentions.
</p>
<p>
	Above all, do <i>not</i> leave any incriminating evidence behind. 
Communications or documents relating to suicide, or the best methods of 
self-termination, such as this posting, are good examples of items which
 should be purged before any sincere attempt to achieve an "accidental 
death" can begin. Think ahead and consider the aftermath of whatever 
decision you may select in the context of a police and/or insurance 
settlement investigation. Coming to understand the operational standards
 and legal parameters of these fields would also be of import if one 
intends to deceive their agents.

		&nbsp;Subject: "Accidental" Suicide
		<br>
		&nbsp;From: <a href="mailto:asm.ref.editor@gmail.com">ASM Ref Editor</a>
		<br>
		&nbsp;Date: February 21, 2000</tt>
</p>
</tt><p><tt>
		&nbsp;&gt; I read the article on suicide, but I didn't see anything on
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt; how to make it look like an accident. Got anything on that?</tt>
</p>
<p>
	The desire to end life without one's relatives or friends suspecting 
that we'd had that in mind is probably most common amongst those whose 
family and acquaintances are emotionally-insecure and interdependent. 
Others may have moral qualms about suicide and post-mortem destinies of 
the "soul," which they suppose will survive the bodily disintegration 
and, in order to "spare them" from this, or from feelings of guilt ("If 
only I'd known I could have <i>done</i> something!" they may say), we 
may wish to conceal many things, inclusive of the nature of our final 
act. Other reasons to try making it look like an accident include trying
 to leave insurance for one's family. The number of films on this 
subject should supply very good ideas as a supplemental source.
</p>
<p>
	The usual methods of concealment include making it look like an 
accident, and disappearance. The first method has attendant 
complications, since some of the suicide methods that will appear to be 
an accident could impinge upon the lives of others who may not wish to 
die (as when someone drives head-on into an oncoming train).
</p>
<p>
	The usual way to fake an accident is to look carefully at the 
international news and consider the ways in which people tend to die. 
There are a great number of vehicular accidents, for example, and this 
is easy to fake but hard to be sure that it will be successful without 
careful planning and avoidance of chance survival. Plunging from a great
 height, or into a body of water, with the windows rolled up in an 
automobile, is likely to be considered "accidental." Smashing into 
objects at high speeds—especially without a safety-belt—is moderately 
likely to result in your demise; in such a case it would be best to aim 
at very dense materials like steel and stone. Compare this with 
industrial accidents in which one falls into the wrong place "by 
accident."
</p>
<p>
	Risk-taking sports tend to result in their share of casualties which 
will be considered accidents, though survival becomes easier when one is
 participating in some common sport where others are likely to be 
present and may interfere by "coming to the rescue." Elemental exposure 
and disregard can be seen as an "accident of negligence," such as when 
one flies during a storm, skis during a blizzard, or hikes through 
sub-freezing temperature zones (in which one might crash or freeze 
respectively).
</p>
<p>
	Electrocution and poisoning are less likely to be believed as 
accidents, but if ignorance or absent-mindedness are common perceptions 
of the individual considering suicide, this may be an option. The 
problem with these are that they can be prone to painful results, 
sometimes even failure. Research into the precise voltage, grounding—or,
 in the case of poison, dosage—for body type and likely effects are 
important supplemental homework.
</p>
<p>
	One of the most important parts of making one's death appear to be an 
accident, aside from actually carrying it through to termination, is the
 cover-up of one's personal life. Text such as that in which this advice
 appears, for example, is likely to be incriminating evidence, so to 
speak, as would any correspondence or expression indicating depression, 
focus on death, or euthanasia. Radical changes in one's life, friends, 
or general behavior can lend reason to suspect "foul play" or a 
"personal problem." Suicide-prevention literature typically contains 
lists of signs that one can watch so as not to evidence them in one's 
life or leavings. Especially important as to the promotion of one's end 
as an accident is the recent initiation of lengthy projects and the 
continuation of one's ongoing affairs. This gives the impression that 
one had intended to be around for a while.

</p>
<p>
	<tt>&nbsp;&gt;&gt; Isn't it the case that most botched suicides are as a
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt;&gt; result of attempted overdose which fails?
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt;
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt; Actually, it does hold the largest percentage, but people are
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt; impulsive, and a <b>lot</b> of them are actually people trying to
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt; get attention; spurned lovers, that sort of thing. Jumping
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt; out in traffic, shooting one's self is the mouth with a (I am
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt; <i>not</i> making this up) .22 short (just ruins the roof of your
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt; mouth—blech). People who have not really thought it out,
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt; just want the attention, or to lay a guilt trip on someone.
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt; They generally do not get very much sympathy from the E.R.
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt; staff—we are sick of them.</tt>
</p>
<p>
	<tt>&nbsp;&gt; People who really mean it have set up closure for themselves
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt; and most of the people around them, and their houses are
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt; spotless. Everything is boxed, labeled, and there is very
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt; little to do. Most have even had the utilities shut off,

</p>
<p>
	Yes, that makes the most sense. Act preventatively to keep people from 
helping, rather than helping them to discover the body first.

	One of the things I would also do is to post a sign on the door of this cabin, something like:

	<tt>&nbsp;&gt; What's the best method to die in the comfort of my own home?</tt>
</p>
<p>
	First, I'll deal with the local environment, <i>then</i> I'll list a couple of suggestions for inside the home.
</p>
<dl>
	<dt>
		<b>Geography</b>
	</dt>
	<dd>
		<dl>
			<dt>
				Hypothermia
			</dt>
			<dd>
				In northern climes, during colder periods of the year, hypothermia 
is a real option. Being wet, without clothes, outside in the snow for a 
good day or two will probably be enough.
			</dd>
			<dt>
				Hypohydria
			</dt>
			<dd>
				Near a body of water such as a swimming pool, lake, or ocean affords
 the weighted swimmer with an easy solution also. Tie enough heavy 
objects to the legs and dive in. Breathe water heavily until dead.
			</dd>
			<dt>
				Cataclysmic Impact from a Height
			</dt>
			<dd>
				Near to great heights, such as canyon cliffs, or in dense urban 
centers, where there are liable to be accessible towers, or very tall 
buildings, makes possible the leap to death. Landing head-first will 
more or less ensure success.
			</dd>
			<dt>
				Cataclysmic Impact by a Fast-Moving Vehicle
			</dt>
			<dd>
				Dwelling by tracks of fast-moving trains gives the suicidal an 
easy-out where there is sufficient concealment such that the train will 
not be able to observe you before you leap in front of it.
			</dd>
		</dl>
	</dd>
	<dt>
		<b>Helpful Home Remedies</b>
	</dt>
	<dd>
		<dl>
			<dt>
				Shotgun to the Brainstem
			</dt>
			<dd>
				Having a shotgun makes killing oneself a snap. Aim for the 
brainstem; be sure that there is a good foundation for the recoil before
 firing.
			</dd>
			<dt>
				Potassium Cyanide (KCN) Consumption
			</dt>
			<dd>
				If you've got some potassium cyanide, or know where you can get some, then the following method may prove valuable):
				<blockquote>
					<ol>
						<li>
							Take a small glass of cold tap water; do not use mineral water, 
nor any kind of juice or soda water, due to the acidity of such liquids.
						</li>
						<li>
							Stir 1g (or 1.5g, at most) of potassium cyanide (KCN) into the 
water; using more than recommended will likely cause burning of the 
throat due to the acidity.
						</li>
						<li>
							After about five minutes—this "waiting period" is important, as a
 chemical reaction needs to take place—the KCN will be dissolved and 
ready to drink (because it has turned into HCN). It remains drinkable 
for a period of several hours, but not much more than that.
						</li>
						<li>
							Once the concoction is drunk, consciousness will be lost within a
 minute. There will be just time to rinse out the glass (to ensure that 
no one else accidentally drinks from it—however, one could just as 
easily put a big "Warning" label onto the glass, or throw it into a 
corner or a fireplace, if one doesn't want to take the time) and lie 
down. But beware—a person extremely weakened by illness might lose 
consciousness within twenty seconds.
						</li>
						<li>
							While in the coma, death will follow in fifteen to forty-five 
minutes, depending on the physical strength of the person and whether 
the stomach is full or empty (an empty stomach promotes faster death).
						</li>
						<li>
							During the coma period, the dying person will breathe heavily or 
snore, similarly to people who have taken a lethal dose of barbiturates 
[See "<a href="#MLD"><b>MLD</b></a>" below.].
						</li>
					</ol>
					<p>
						[Hans] Atrott notes that with a person who is seriously terminally
 ill, death is so peaceful that often doctors do not detect suicide, and
 sign the death certificate as being from natural causes.
					</p>

				—<i>Final Exit,</i> by <a href="mailto:dhumphry@efn.org">Derek Humphry</a>, <a href="http://www.hemlock.org/">The Hemlock Society</a>, 1991, pp. 44-5.
				<p>
					This is also the German Society for Humane Dying's recommended suicide method, as related by <a href="mailto:dhumphry@efn.org">Derek Humphry</a>. If anyone else has information we can add to it, please let me know as a followup to this post.
				</p>
				<p>
					However, this is not the method which Humphry finally recommends, 
because he is concerned that cyanide might not be fast and painless 
enough, having heard a multitude of stories about its effects. He has a 
whole chapter on cyanide of various types and it is worthwhile reading.
				</p>
				<p>
					No, his recommendation is directed toward those who have a terminal
 illness (who may be in a weakened condition and who may have built up a
 tolerance to one or more pain- killers). Without the assistance of a 
doctor, he recommends ingestion of Seconal (secobarbital) and/or 
Nembutal (pentobarbital) combined with a plastic bag over the head to 
ensure suffocation while comatose.
				</p>
				<p>
					Humphry's focus on the digestive process is admirable, and he goes 
into some great detail about what should and should not be done prior to
 killing oneself via this method (Ibid., p. 110+).
				</p>
				<p>
					Of particularly great importance when engaging in the overdose 
method (he says that alcohol increases the lethality of such substances 
by 50% and provides a good chart in the back which gives lethal doses of
 many pharmaceuticals) is the <i>prior</i> ingestion (an hour 
beforehand) of Dramamine to prevent nausea and vomitting of the pills. 
He notes also that one of the other problem of oral administration is 
that people will sometimes go to sleep prior to completing a lethal 
dose, and so suggests that one use alcohol to wash down a number of 
pills, or just a few while gobbling the rest very quickly in a 
pre-prepared pudding.
				</p>
				<p>
					His recommendations about having a <u>suicide note</u>, <u>Living Will</u>, and <u>Last Will and Testament</u> are invaluable for those serious about ending their lives with grace.

</p>
<p>
	<tt>
		&nbsp;&gt; Can somebody suggest me a way to kill myself?
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt; I am disabled, cannot walk, can lift my arms just a little,
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt; and have no firearms. I am so tired.</tt>
</p>
<p>
	The disabled and terminally-ill are the most prone to have serious 
desires to end their lives, based on their quality of life for the 
remainder of their days. They are <i>also</i> the most likely to receive
 help from unexpected quarters (especially the terminally ill) when 
attempting to secure reliable methods. Witness the repeated help of 
individuals like Saint Kevorkian and his compassionate response to those
 who wish to die with the assistance of a doctor. Today there are even 
opportunities for the terminally ill such as state-supported 
physician-assistance if one chooses to live in the proper area of the 
world (as of this writing, at least in Oregon, U.S., if not in 
Denmark—or was that latter Australia?).
</p>
<p>
	Probably the most rational methods for the terminally ill which may 
apply to the disabled also have been covered by authors such as Geo 
Stone and <a href="mailto:dhumphry@efn.org">Derek Humphry</a>. The 
typical recommendation is some combination of prescription medicine—or 
relaxing substance like barbiturates—and alcohol, or suffocation. 
Obviously, disabilities will affect one's access to this method, since 
overdosing requires an ability to administer the substance, but if one 
has some small use of one's limbs then there is a good chance that this 
method is available to the disabled as well.
</p>
<p>
	The usual method of obtaining the barbiturates is to approach one's 
doctor and ask for sleep medication. Accepting this, a return visit at a
 later time is necessary to complain that the lower-power medicine which
 is usually prescribed for first-use is insufficient to facilitate one's
 slumbers. The second or third visit, if the doctor does not prescribe 
some kind of barbiturate, the recommendation is that one nonchalantly 
mention that a friend said she was greatly assisted by some kind of 
barbiturate, and that you think this may be what you need also. If the 
doctor does not cooperate, you may need to get a referral to see another
 doctor who will.
</p>
<p>
	Once you have obtained the proper prescription, stockpile these 
substances until you have acquired what you can determine is a lethal 
dosage (see <a href="#LD-50MLD"><b>below</b></a> or consult a more reliable source).
</p>
<p>
	The sources mentioned above indicate that some type of anti-nausea 
preliminary are an important part of the overdose, as is eating very 
lightly previous to the ingestion. Another important facet of overdosing
 is timing: choosing a place and a time when one is unlikely to be found
 unconscious (like in a locked apartment's closet which one occasionally
 leaves, on a Friday) is imperative to success. If one is under 
prescription for any similar types of medication, then these should be 
discontinued for three or four days in advance so as to minimize the 
risk of tolerance resistance (with terminal illness this period may be 
reduced based on one's debilitated condition).
</p>
<p>
	Groups like the <a href="http://www.hemlock.org/">Hemlock Society</a> 
do not trust the overdose method completely, and with good reason: 
quantities of substances as compared to personal resistance, due to body
 type, genetics, and overall bodily health, make ingestion of 
prescription medicines a variable which can have unforeseen consequences
 (particularly failure, and winding up in worse circumstances than one 
already faces). Pharmaceuticals provide information that is at times 
confusing to the <i>intentionally suicidal,</i> and this can lead to a botched job where it had seemed a sure thing.
</p>
<p>
	For this reason, the <a href="http://www.hemlock.org/">Hemlock Society</a> recommends to its (terminally-ill) audience the <b>addition</b> of a plastic bag to place over the head in conjunction with the overdose. In his book, <a href="mailto:dhumphry@efn.org">Derek Humphry</a>, the founder of the <a href="http://www.hemlock.org/">Hemlock Society</a>,
 describes using a rubber band with the bag, like a kind of headband or 
necklace, placing the bag and band together in one smooth motion. Since 
this book was published the <a href="http://www.hemlock.org/">Hemlock Society</a>
 has begun recommending that the bag be loosely fitted over the head 
with a light-but-effective weight, such as a pillow, over the flap of 
the bag on the chest. This method would provide a kind of 
double-assurance, attempting to arrest one's breathing with chemicals 
while limiting the available oxygen which <i>can</i> be breathed in case the overdose doesn't do more than render the individual unconscious.

	&nbsp;Subject: Duration and Quality of Suicide (was "Death, Not Pain")
	<br>
	&nbsp;Date: Thu, 13 May 1999 10:56:45 -0700 (PDT)</tt>
<p>
	<tt>&nbsp;&gt; What's the least painful way to commit suicide?</tt>
</p>
<p>
	There are two factors of importance in considering the experience of 
the suicide (ignoring collateral considerations like how the suicide 
will affect others): first, the <b><u>duration</u></b> before death (whether we would wish it extended or shortened; conventionally considered "short" and "long"), and the <b><u>quality</u></b> of the subjective experience over the <b>course</b> of that duration (often painful, pleasurable, or of a neutral quality).
</p>
<p>
	The question of "the least painful way to intentionally end one's life"
 only takes into consideration the qualitative element of this 
experience. It is <b>affected</b> by the duration if disintegration/death occurs prior to the experience of pain (achieving a "neutral" quality at best).
</p>
<p>
	Therefore my response falls into two categorical types of intentional death: <u>concussion</u> and <u>intoxication</u>. <u>Concussion</u>
 involves the incapacitation of nervous system receptors prior to their 
activation (as in being at the detonation point of a large bomb). <u>Intoxication</u>
 includes the administration of gaseous or liquid substances such that 
pain is ameliorated by virtue of unconsciousness or absent by virtue of 
life-threatening developments which do not impact the nervous system.
</p>
<p>
	In considering intentionally ending one's life I will focus on means of suicide that <i>should</i>
 be commonly available to the individual citizen in an enlightened 
culture (projectile weapons, certain intoxicants), and I may omit 
possibilities available to the privileged and/or technically adept (e.g.
 nuclear weaponry).
</p>
<dl>
	<dt>
		<b>Concussion</b>
	</dt>
	<dd>
		The easiest method of quickly incapacitating the nervous system is 
through a debilitating impact to the brain stem. This can be 
administered with a projectile weapon of sufficient caliber (such as a 
shotgun) aimed at the proper angle so as to disintegrate the head and 
end life immediately. It does require that one overcome one's own 
feelings of self-preservation or fear of self-inflicted pain in order to
 aim and correctly fire the weapon. Adequately preparing for recoil can 
also be important.
	</dd>
	<dt>
		<br>
		<b>Intoxication</b>
	</dt>
	<dd>
		A self-administered dosage (by a "Mercitron-like" mechanism) of the 
substance used in killing unwanted pets, unwanted or damaged work 
animals, or those humans who have either been sentenced to die as a 
punishment for their heinous behavior (murder, torture, etc.) or who 
have requested assistance in dying (e.g. like those who have terminal 
illnesses and have sought succor in the assistance of Doctor Death, 
A.K.A. Saint Kevorkian) is a very valuable way to avoid pain at the time
 of death.
		<p>
			If more attention is paid to the <b>quality</b> of the duration, rather than merely avoidance of pain, then there may be more pleasant ways of terminating one's life.
		</p>
		<p>
			These include the self-administration of substances like nitrous 
oxide (which displaces oxygen and produces euphoria), or some more 
common recreational substance such as heroin, which, in sufficient 
quantity and composition, can cause a depressive reaction that will kill
 while including the euphoria that recreational users desire.
		</p>
		<p>
			The best methods I've seen described so far are somewhat messy. Yet they <i>can</i>
 be taken to remote locations (e.g., shotgun to the brain stem in the 
wilderness) and even protected with "Suicide Scene Ahead, Beware" signs 
for the truly insufferable empath. The drive-yourself-hanging (probably 
resulting in a decapitation and an auto crash) seems pretty easy, 
physically, to arrange, and might lead to some interesting sensations.
		</p>
		<p>
			The classic desire is for a chemical that will "put one to sleep" 
(which is what we do to pets when they become inconvenient). I'm unaware
 of any substance legally obtained which will achieve this. Barbiturates
 (as are suggested by authors like <a href="mailto:dhumphry@efn.org">Derek Humphry</a>) work in combination with a bag if done right, but even these may have problems, as the <a href="http://www.hemlock.org/">Hemlock Society</a> has made clear by its postscript advocation of pillows on the front flaps of the bags.
		</p>
		Guns and falls appear to be the most certain violent means. Get a 
shotgun and aim at the brain stem—even with a botched attempt, if you're
 far enough from civilized assistance you'll die from blood loss. Get 
atop a communications tower (higher than most buildings and far from 
pedestrians) and jump, and you're unlikely to survive it, especially if 
you rig piano wire to lop off your head at the outset.
	</dd>
	<dt>
		<br>
		<b>Ideals</b>
	</dt>
	<dd>
		There are more risky and potentially pleasant means of ending one's 
life that could also require study and a careful preparation, if not 
participation, from others whose specialty is desirable.
		<p>
			Many find the ecstasy of orgasm is attractive as a last experience in
 their life. This could be combined with a pill or injection of some 
kind to be self-administered at a pre-determined moment so as to bring 
about cardiac arrest or collapse into unconsciousness at the end of an 
erotic fantasy funeral culminating in rapture and death.
		</p>
		<p>
			It is this latter kind of intentional suicide (by whatever standards 
of the individual)—the kind which is exceedingly pleasing and enjoyable 
to the person who has chosen to die—rather than one which merely 
minimizes pain, that I am most interested in making possible.

	<br>
	Suicides through ingestion, injection, and inhalation all depend on similar factors as regards efficiency:
</p>
<dl>
	<dt>
		<b>Person Effecting the Method</b>
	</dt>
	<dd>
		Body weight, age, physical condition, and skill in assessment of the necessary dosage <a href="#III.A.2.a"><b>(see "LD-50/MLD" below)</b></a>—or
 substance to achieve the desired result—can vary tremendously. Heavier 
people may require greater quantities of lethal substances to bring them
 down. The elderly may be more prone to the snuff than the young and 
vibrant body. Ignorant and/or clumsy individuals may administer the 
wrong dosage, use the wrong delivery equipment or substance, and may 
generally botch the job. The sickly and terminally ill or 
immunologically-challenged may be more amenable to depressive and/or 
toxic termination.
	</dd>
	<dt>
		<br>
		<b>Method of Delivery</b>
	</dt>
	<dd>
		Pills are one of the more simple methods available, though they are 
tightly controlled in some countries by government agencies. Raw herbs 
or roots may be readily available, though many of these will not bring 
the type of painless suicide so many seek out. Chemical injections can 
be quite effective, though again as with pills the chemicals may have to
 be manufactured oneself or procured through a black market source, and 
some degree of familiarity with needles and the cardiovascular system is
 an asset in this type of delivery. Possible sources of assistance where
 injections are concerned would be organizations or services which 
assist diabetics or homecare nursing. Inhalants which displace 
breathable oxygen have qualities such as pressure and temperature which 
cannot be overlooked, nor can their availability and quality.
	</dd>
	<dt>
		<br>
		<b>Agent of Demise</b>
	</dt>
	<dd>
		Besides knowing <i>what</i> substance one is dealing with, or the 
proper dosage, an entire range of opportunity for error is raised when 
considering the probable effects, whether they will lead to death, and 
in what manner of experience. Substances well-known for suicide such as 
alcohol, or pills (such as valium), in <i>conjunction</i> with alcohol, 
are manufactured in varying strengths, often provided with numbers to 
indicate this strength. Pills are often prescribed by doctors who may 
not even know the actual lethal dosage, even in combination with other 
ingestables. Sometimes the dangers are <u>exaggerated</u> intentionally 
so as to make fewer suicide attempts actually result in success. 
Digestion can become disrupted by some substances and combinations, so 
that vomiting may prevent the demise, or may become the primary cause of
 death (choking on vomit incapable of being expelled due to a depression
 of bodily systems). Substances introduced can lead to serious 
debilitation without death, and the pain of some substances, even while 
leading to death, can become an inhibiting factor.
	</dd>
	<dt>
		<br>
		<b>Suicide Disruption</b>
	</dt>
	<dd>
		Because some of these methods are time-dependent and may take awhile 
to come to fruition, there is also the chance of interruption by 
well-meaning but intrusive individuals who call in authorities who take 
life-saving actions, discontinue the administration of the agent in 
question, or otherwise end the termination process without the 
permission of the person who had intended suicide. Choosing a place and 
time conducive to privacy and uninterrupted suicide becomes integral to 
success, as does proper preparation in the face of equipment failure, 
the loss of potency of agents, and other unforeseen complications.

	<br>
	Ingestion of antifreeze has been discussed in <a href="news:alt.suicide.methods">alt.suicide.methods</a>. Based on the following (from <a href="http://embbs.com/cr/alc/alc7.html">http://embbs.com/cr/alc/alc7.html</a>, it appears that death by this method could be very unpleasant.
</p>
<blockquote cite="http://embbs.com/cr/alc/alc7.html">
	<p>
		<b>Ethylene Glycol</b>
	</p>
	<dl>
		<dt>
			<b>General</b>
		</dt>
		<dd>
			Ethylene glycol is a clear, colorless, odorless, viscous liquid with a
 sweet taste, that can produce dramatic toxicity. It is commonly found 
in homes and industry. It is found most commonly in antifreeze, 
automotive cooling systems, and hydraulic brake fluids. In an industrial
 setting it is used as a solvent or as the raw material for a variety of
 processes. Many cases of ethylene glycol poisoning results from 
accidental ingestion by children who can take in large amounts since the
 substance tastes good. Alcoholics may also ingest this substance as an 
ethanol substitute.
		</dd>
		<dt>
			<br>
			<b>Pharmacology</b>
		</dt>
		<dd>
			Ethylene glycol is rapidly absorbed once it is ingested and is then 
widely distributed into body tissues. Peak blood levels are generally 
seen in one to four hours. Exposure to the skin and lungs may cause 
irritation but does not cause the systemic toxicity in the way that 
methanol does. Lethal quantities in adults are considered to be 100 ml, 
but in children much less may cause serious cardiac, renal, and CNS 
toxicity.
			<p>
				Ethylene glycol itself is relatively nontoxic. After absorption the 
unchanged compound undergoes glomerular filtration and passive 
reabsorption. It is then broken down into metabolites that are highly 
toxic and cause the associated findings of ethylene glycol toxicity. 
Ethylene glycol is converted to glycoaldehyde by alcohol dehydrogenase. 
This is the rate limiting step of a reaction in the liver that continues
 to breakdown the glycoaldehyde into glycolate, glyoxylate, and oxylate…
			</p>
			<p>
				These metabolites inhibit oxidative phosphorylation, 
sulfhydrl-containing enzymes, and protein synthesis. Glycolic acid is 
the major cause of the metabolic acidosis that is seen in ethylene 
glycol toxicity, although glyoxylic acid also may contribute. Toxicity 
from ethylene glycol is produced from the above metabolites and the fact
 that they cause a severe acidosis, as well as from the fact that 
oxalate precipitates with calcium to produce widespread tissue injury in
 the kidney, brain, liver, blood vessels, and pericardium. Hypocalcemia 
may also result.
			</p>
		</dd>
		<dt>
			<b>Clinical Presentation</b>
		</dt>
		<dd>
			The clinical presentation of ethylene glycol toxicity is generally divided into three fairly well-defined phases:
			<ol type="I">
				<li>
					<b>CNS Depression Phase</b>
					<br>
					The first phase occurs within 30 minutes to 12 hours. At this 
phase, the patient may appear intoxicated with nausea, vomiting, ataxia,
 absent reflexes, nystagmus, and myoclonic jerks but has no smell of 
alcohol. Coma and seizures (focal or generalized) may occur or there may
 be tetany if hypocalcemia is present. CNS depression may be from the 
ethylene glycol itself or from the metabolites. Abdominal pain, 
myalgias, and hematemesis may be present. Dilated pupils with loss of 
the light reflexes, papilledema, and blurred optic discs have been 
reported with ethylene glycol intoxication, but are much more common in 
methanol poisoning.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Cardiopulmonary Toxicity Phase</b>
					<br>
					This phase usually begins at 12-72 hours after ingestion. At this 
point mild hypertension, tachycardia, and tachypnea may be seen. If 
toxicity is severe this may progress to congestive heart failure, 
pulmonary edema, and pneumonitis. This phase is thought to be the result
 of calcium oxylate crystals within the vascular tree, lung parenchyma, 
and the myocardium.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Renal Toxicity Phase</b>
					<br>
					This phase occurs 24-72 hours after ingestion and consists of flank
 and abdominal pain with evidence of acute tubular necrosis that is 
manifest as oliguric renal failure.
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				While some patients may clearly manifest these classic phases of 
poisoning many people will not have such clear progression. Some 
patients will develop mild hypothermia with bradycardia and 
hypertension. Coma with cerebral edema, renal failure, and pancytopenia 
have also been described. In cases of ethylene glycol from child abuse 
the presenting signs were unexplained recurrent metabolic acidosis with 
severe vomiting. This diagnosis should be considered in children with a 
metabolic acidosis.

	<b>Potassium Cyanide (KCN) Consumption</b>
	<br>
	If you've got some potassium cyanide, or know where you can get some, 
then the following method may prove valuable (provided by <a href="mailto:dhumphry@efn.org">Derek Humphry</a>):
</p>
<blockquote>
	<ol>
		<li>
			Take a small glass of cold tap water; do not use mineral water, nor 
any kind of juice or soda water, due to the acidity of such liquids.
		</li>
		<li>
			Stir 1g (or 1.5g, at most) of potassium cyanide (KCN) into the water;
 using more than recommended will likely cause burning of the throat due
 to the acidity.
		</li>
		<li>
			After about five minutes—this "waiting period" is important, as a 
chemical reaction needs to take place—the KCN will be dissolved and 
ready to drink (because it has turned into HCN). It remains drinkable 
for a period of several hours, but not much more than that.
		</li>
		<li>
			Once the concoction is drunk, consciousness will be lost within a 
minute. There will be just time to rinse out the glass (to ensure that 
no one else accidentally drinks from it—however, one could just as 
easily put a big "Warning" label onto the glass, or throw it into a 
corner or a fireplace, if one doesn't want to take the time) and lie 
down. But beware—a person extremely weakened by illness might lose 
consciousness within twenty seconds.
		</li>
		<li>
			While in the coma, death will follow in fifteen to forty-five 
minutes, depending on the physical strength of the person and whether 
the stomach is full or empty (an empty stomach promotes faster death).
		</li>
		<li>
			During the coma period, the dying person will breathe heavily or 
snore, similarly to people who have taken a lethal dose of barbiturates.
		</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		[Hans] Atrott notes that with a person who is seriously terminally 
ill, death is so peaceful that often doctors do not detect suicide, and 
sign the death certificate as being from natural causes.

—<i>Final Exit,</i> by <a href="mailto:dhumphry@efn.org">Derek Humphry</a>, <a href="http://www.hemlock.org/">The Hemlock Society</a>, 1991, pp. 44-5.
<p>
	This is also the German Society for Humane Dying's recommended suicide method, as related by <a href="mailto:dhumphry@efn.org">Derek Humphry</a>. If anyone else has information we can add to it, please let me know as a followup to this post.
</p>
<p>
	However, this is not the method which Humphry finally recommends, 
because he is concerned that cyanide might not be fast and painless 
enough, having heard a multitude of stories about its effects. He has a 
whole chapter on cyanide of various types and it is worthwhile reading.
</p>
<p>
	No, his recommendation is directed toward those who have a terminal 
illness (who may be in a weakened condition and who may have built up a 
tolerance to one or more pain- killers). Without the assistance of a 
doctor, he recommends ingestion of Seconal (secobarbital) and/or 
Nembutal (pentobarbital) combined with a plastic bag over the head to 
ensure suffocation while comatose.
</p>
<p>
	Humphry's focus on the digestive process is admirable, and he goes into
 some great detail about what should and should not be done prior to 
killing oneself via this method (Ibid., p. 110+).
</p>
<p>
	Of particularly great importance when engaging in the overdose method 
(he says that alcohol increases the lethality of such substances by 50% 
and provides a good chart in the back which gives lethal doses of many 
pharmaceuticals) is the <i>prior</i> ingestion (an hour beforehand) of 
Dramamine to prevent nausea and vomitting of the pills. He notes also 
that one of the other problem of oral administration is that people will
 sometimes go to sleep prior to completing a lethal dose, and so 
suggests that one use alcohol to wash down a number of pills, or just a 
few while gobbling the rest very quickly in a pre-prepared pudding.
</p>
<p>
	His recommendations about having a <u>suicide note</u>, <u>Living Will</u>, and <u>Last Will and Testament</u> are invaluable for those serious about ending their lives with grace.
</p>
<p>
	<tt>&nbsp;From: anonymous</tt>
</p>
<p>
	I've mentioned before that the cyanide constituent in kernels of 
almonds, peaches, apples, cherries, and apricots is not free 
hydrogen-cyanide, which is a gas; rather, the compound is amygdalin. It 
is cyanide bound safely to benzaldehyde and glued shut with a couple of 
sugars. (For a picture, look in the Merck Index, or visit <a href="http://www.gov.sg/moh/mohiss/poison/pgamygdl.html">http://www.gov.sg/moh/mohiss/poison/pgamygdl.html</a>.)
</p>
<p>
	As long as the molecule remains intact, it is harmless. Strong acid 
should decompose the compound to release free HCN, but I was wondering 
whether stomach acid is strong enough. Turns out, it isn't. The neat 
thing about these plant seeds is that the compound is packaged within 
them separately from three enzymes that rapidly decompose amygdalin. So 
when the seed is thoroughly crushed under moist conditions, that is when
 HCN is released—an effective defense against insect predators. A 
biologist is studying how the enzymes are manufactured separately from 
amygdalin and compartmentalized into different tissues within black 
cherries…
</p>
<p>
	Humans have bacteria in our gut that manufacture beta-glucosidase, and 
to a degree this enzyme can act to release HCN as well, but there are 
other enzymes and processes that can act to transform HCN to the 
harmless thiocyanate nearly as fast.
</p>
<p>
	Amygdalin was given as a quack, heavily-promoted cancer treatment in 
the seventies. It was variously known as Laetrile, and even passed off 
as Vitamin B17, which ostensibly was a nutrient that would prevent one 
from getting cancer. Now, this was purified amygdalin, without the 
enzymes that would cause it to spontaneously break down, so people could
 ingest gram amounts daily without tremendous side-effects. (The theory 
was that cancer cells would possess more b-glucosidase than normal 
cells, so cyanide would selectively kill them over normal cells; but 
these ideas about the disparity or even presence of these enzymes was 
shown to be simply not true. And there were rigorous, double-blind 
studies that demonstrated no benefit to laetrile in the treatment of 
cancer.)
</p>
<p>
	Lethal or near-lethal cyanide poisoning using laetrile would usually 
involve ingestion of gram amounts of the purified 'drug' along with a 
source of the hydrolyzing enzymes. In one case, a man ate a lot of 
bitter almonds one day. In another, a woman ate freshly crushed apricot 
pits with her laetrile pills.
</p>
<p>
	Most of the poisonings (except in children) were nonlethal, and 
side-effects were severe and damage occasionally permament. Laetrile is 
still available in Mexico, and in fact I found a place on the web where 
one could apparently order some, but they have a screening process of 
sorts and depending on your location may not be able to deliver.

</p>
<p>
	Yep. In fact, if you eat the seeds, you will be releasing some HCN. I 
like eating apple seeds because the benzaldehyde that is released along 
with the HCN has a pleasing almondy taste. ([name omitted] suggested it 
is rather like Dr. Pepper, and I think that's so.)
</p>
<p>
	Anyway, you'd want the seeds to be thoroughly crushed <u>and moist</u>, and would want to ingest them immediately. (Alternatively, you could find some way to harvest the gas.)
</p>
<p>
	The issue here is <u>quantity</u>. How much would you have to cram into
 your stomach to get several grams of amygdalin? And it's possible, too,
 that the enzymes won't work as well once they're in the mildly acidic 
environment of the stomach. About that I'm not sure. But if it simply 
slowed=down hydrolysis, the poisoning would be time-released: 
excruciating, prolonged, and not necessarily effective.

	So yes, certainly a <i>possible</i> method. But it would not be my choice, though; I wouldn't even consider it.

	On that point, I imagine a contraption: an industrial-sized, airtight 
crushing device, where peach pits are compressed and mixed in a small 
amount of water, and maybe heated somewhat above room temperature. This 
is connected to tubing that bubbles through a solution of potassium 
hydroxide. When the pH of the solution becomes neutral, there are the 
same number of molecules KCN as there were KOH.

	I was reading <i>The Big Book of Death</i> this morning (which I 
recommend), from Factoid Books, 1995, and in the chapter on Capital 
Punishment ("Capital Punishment, It's a Gas") a comic panel read:
</p>
<blockquote>
	Deadly gas is released when cyanide pellets are dropped into shallow pans of sulfuric acid mixed with water.
</blockquote>
…and it goes on to describe the symptoms of cyanide poisoning as 
including gasping, wheezing, thrashing, screaming, crying, one's face 
turning purple, tongues sticking out, drooling, and that this does <i>not</i> happen "particularly fast."
<p>
	All in all, I'd suggest it may not be a very effective method of 
suicide (in the sense of "painless," at least). And yet, what is the 
comparative concentration of the "gas chamber pellet" to the crushed 
peach pit? What would the likely differences be between inhaling and 
ingestion, where death is concerned? Are there not "cyanide pills," used
 for quick-acting deaths among spies?

		Cyanide poisoning can occur if too many apple pips are eaten (about a 
cupful has been known to kill a man). Many fruit kernels (apricots, for 
example) contain cyanogenic glycosides, and without prolonged boiling, 
enzymes may release hydrocyanic acid and cause cyanide poisoning.

</p>
<p>
	Cyanide is found in pear seeds, as well, and is very simple to extract.
 All you have to do is get about 1/2-1 lb. of seeds, then dry them; 
after that, crush them into a powder, and mix said powder into your 
favorite juice, some mashed potatoes, et cetera.

	<tt>&nbsp;&gt; I sure do know that you don't just run down to

		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt; Often KCN suppliers will only sell to an

		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt; (i.e., a jewelry store). If they suspect you

		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt; irrelevant.</tt>
</p>
<p>
	I have to disagree. I bought 1 oz. of sodium cyanide from a chemical 
supply house in Oreagn back in 1995. All I had to do was sign a paper 
saying I wasn't going to do anything illegel with it and that I wasn't a
 minor. I could have bought potassium cyanide for a little bit more 
money. The stuff was dirt-cheap but it cost a fortune to ship it.

                &nbsp;&gt;Hi, what happens if i drink alcohol before
                <br>
                &nbsp;&gt; drinking my cyanide solution?... </tt>
</p>

<p>
	In the case of cyanide poisoning, I do not think that a small amount of alcohol would make much difference to the outcome....
</p>

<p>
	I think that, for suicide purposes, sodium cyanide and potassium cyanide are fairly equivalent.
</p>

<p>
	[Humphry's "Final Exit," above] is probably good advice....
</p>

<p>
	However...
</p>

<p>
[previous Practical Guide to Suicide advice:]
	<tt>
                <br>
		&nbsp;&gt;...One tablespoon is enough, but take two. 
                <br>
                &nbsp;&gt; Cool tap water is fine, but since it will be
                <br>
                &nbsp;&gt; your last drink, use something you like, such
                <br>
                &nbsp;&gt; as Kool Aid, lemonade, orange juice.... </tt>
</p>

<p>
	This advice ...contradicts Humphry's advice and should, I think, be ignored.
</p>

<p>
	A tablespoon is 15ml. Two tablespoons are 30ml. Given that the density 
of sodium (or potassium) cyanide is about 1.5 this would be about 45 
grams of cyanide and would burn the mouth and throat.
</p>

<p>
and later:
	<tt>
                <br>
                &nbsp;&gt; Sodium cyanide can kill in amounts as small as 
                <br>
                &nbsp;&gt; 600 mg. It should work almost the same as 
                <br>
                &nbsp;&gt; Potassium cyanide but i think the LD-50 is a 
                <br>
                &nbsp;&gt; little higher for sodium cyanide. </tt> 
</p>

<p>
	In fact the ratoral LD50 for the potassium salt is usually given as 10 mg/kg and the sodium salt has a lower value: 6.4 mg/kg.

<p>
	<tt>&nbsp;Potassium chloride (KCl) is very similar to
		<br>

		<br>

</p>
<p>
	<tt>&nbsp;As to lethal doses, well, 117mg/kg can,

		<br>
		&nbsp;proper circumstances, as little as 18 mg/kg
		<br>
		&nbsp;can be instantly lethal to a 75 kg (165 lb.) adult.
		<br>

	Clomipramine/Potassium Chloride (KCl) overdose This would have 
certainly succeeded, had I not been found ten hours after the overdose.
</p>
<p>
	I took 60 tablets of clomipramine 75mg each (a classic tricyclic 
antidepressant) and 50 tablets of Slow-K 600mg (potassium chloride). By 
the time they found me I was comatose hypothermic, in cardiac arrest but
 unfortunately they revived me. If you try this in an environment where 
you won't be found, it is a very pleasant way to go. The reason I had 
KCl was because I am bulemic and because of all the vomiting your blood 
potassium level will decrease. If you are not blessed with this eating 
disorder there is another way to get your potassium down. Start taking 
laxatives. You need to do this for a while and in the beginning it may 
be somewhat uncomfortable. Then go see your doctor and ask for a blood 
check up. If your K levels are below 3.2 he will prescribe potassium 
supplements. But you probably need the Clomipramine to go with it, so 
you should try acting depressed also. Since the docs know I overdosed on
 it they no longer give me harmful antidepressants, and thus it is no 
longer an option for me. My next try will be a heroin overdose. 
Hopefully I won't be able to tell you about it.

	You might want to look at deleting entries, or at least posting 
non-lethality warnings, on things that are at clear variance with easily
 consulted chemical texts. There is a post from 1996 [<a href="#LD-50MLD"><b>below</b></a>]
 that you have with a so-called "minimum lethal dose;" first of all, 
people are seizing on this MLD as an accurate dose to use when it's 
likely a dose that killed someone who either was already chemically 
compromised in some way, or else was allergic; secondly, of course, 
people waking up on gurneys just isn't what I think CoE is aimed at. 
=&gt;
</p>
<p>
	The focus in <a href="news:alt.suicide.holiday">alt.suicide.holiday</a> is on trying to figure out the dosage that is likely to kill just about <i>anyone.</i> The LD-50 is what is believed will kill 50% of people who take it (it's only tested on rats or mice, usually).
</p>
<p>
	So, if the focus of this group was poison control, we'd probably refer 
to the LD-50 as a "deadly dose," because, to be on the safe side from 
the poison control point of view, someone who had taken the LD-50 should
 be brought to the emergency room <b>immediately.</b>
</p>
<p>
	But, the focus <b>here</b> is on being <i>sure</i> of dying, and 50% is
 damn low odds considering the cost of failure. Thus, dosages quoted 
here are often several times the LD-50 (as toxicity often does not 
follow a straight line for that last 20% or so). Remember, these are 
dosages for people to die with, not the maximum "safe" dose to 
self-medicate with.
</p>
<p>
	When I post LD-50 information, I add the following:
</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
		P.S.: "LD-50" means the amount of drug it took to kill 50% of the 
subject group, usually mice or rats. Doubling the dosage does not 
necessarily make it 100%. mg/kg means that for each kg that you weigh 
(Americans: 1 kg = 2.2 lb) you need that dose in mg; for example if it 
were 2mg/kg and you weighed 70kg you'd need 140 mg for the LD-50. Note 
too that doubling that amount does not ensure death. People vary. People
 take six times the lethal dose of something and manage somehow to 
survive because bodies differ.
	</p>
	<p>
		Although LD-50 is the best measure available, it does not necessarily 
equate exactly to humans. Unfortunately, human data is not available 
because the FDA won't let drug companies take a pool of 1200 or so 
humans and feed them a drug until 600 are dead.
	</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
	In the other direction of focus, however, LD-50 is a damn risky dose to take if you're <i>not</i> trying to die…

<p>
	Alcohol via enema is, depending upon whom you ask, three to six times 
more potent than alcohol via mouth. Absorption is fast, and, as you 
point out, vomiting is not an effective recourse. Be careful in 
experimentation: start with something like one-sixth of what you would 
take via mouth, and try another dose only in a seperate session after 
fully recovering from a previous dose (at least twelve hours). Same for 
other drugs administered rectally that would normally be taken orally, 
such as caffeine, etc.
</p>
<p>
	I gather that the short-term lethal effect of alcohol overdose is 
caused by oxygen deprivation as the body overworks trying to oxidize the
 alcohol. Likely to be quite uncomfortable, even given the slight 
anæsthetic effect. Also, hard alcohol would create an agonizing burning 
sensation in the lower intestine, which, along with the cramping, would 
obviously make one quite miserable while waiting for the effects. Note 
also that most people cannot easily hold even two quarts of comfortable 
warm salted water (osmosis-balanced), much less an irritating fluid, 
even with a <a href="https://archive.ashspace.org/asm_guide/bardexdevice.html"><b>bardex device</b></a>
 (inflatable backflow prevention). [such as the Contiform vaginal plug 
manufactured by C.R. Bard or a medical anal plug such as those 
manufactured by Coloplast -- the Conveen Anal Plug, for example! --

	<tt>&nbsp;&gt;&gt;Yummy. DH is a waste of time, get some street grade

		&nbsp;&gt;&gt;smack. Much nicer way to go, if you don't get the

		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt;
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt; …My objective is <i>not</i> to get high, you idiot.
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt;Also, the risk factors for procuring the smack are
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt;too high. Death from street smack is uncertain.
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt;Besides, I don't know where I would get it from.</tt>
</p>
<p>
	Death from heroin is very certain if you inject enough of it, and—most 
importantly—are not "rescued." Parameds just give you a shot of 
[norcain?] and all effects of H disappear almost straight away. It can 
be purchased in any bigish city. Good dealers are quite used to 
transactions with professionals and "straight" people but are quite 
expensive.
</p>
<p>
	Of course it is a controlled substance and you will be charged if caught by law enforcement so the risk factor is quite high.
</p>
<p>
	In high doses it kills by turning off the brain, specifically the part of the brain that controls breathing. It's <i>not</i>
 like asphyxiation—your body doesn't cry out for air or anything like 
that—it just forgets that it needs to breathe and you just sorta "fade 
away." It lower doses it doesn't turn off the brain so far, just enough 
to make you forget external stimuli and the world.

	<tt>&nbsp;&gt; I have on hand about 1 gram of codeine (actually is

		&nbsp;&gt; 150 tablets of 375 mg acetylsalicylic acid with 8mg
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt; Codeine.)</tt>
</p>
<p>
	If you use the codeine, dissolve the tablets in 2ml water per tablet 
and pass the liquid through a coffee filter. Keep the liquid and throw 
away the aspirin.
</p>
<p>
	<tt>&nbsp;&gt; According to info on a couple web pages, the

		&nbsp;&gt; combination of codeine and dimenhydrate can induce
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt; deep sedation. Is this reliable?</tt>
</p>
<p>
	Only with a plastic bag. Codeine inhibits itself when taken orally so 
is not the best method to use. Combine the codeine and diphenhydramine 
with cyanide, preferably straight into your veins, and then it should 
hopefully be fairly painless.

		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt; the bag, you don't need a big supply—just enough to
		<br>

		&nbsp;&gt; sleeping pills might still work. I guess
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt; diphenhydramine would probably be the best of those.

	It depends on the mushrooms in question. Some are pretty poisonous, but
 then so are many non-psychotropic species. Most 'shrooms sold as 
"magic" mushrooms are not likely to be overly poisonous. Perhaps your 
friend was picking his own? Have a look at <a href="http://www.erowid.org/">www.erowid.org</a> and <a href="http://www.lycaeum.org/">www.lycaeum.org</a> for more info. <a href="http://lycaeum.shroomery.org/">lycaeum.shroomery.org</a>
 is also worth a look. I don't really understand how you are going to 
get coke if you can't get heroin. I wouldn't go the coke route, though, 
as it's not likely to be nearly as pleasant. Basically, you will die of a
 heart-attack, as far as I know. Why are you so intent on illegal drugs?
 It seems there are easier ways for you to go.

		<br>
		Barbiturates depress the central nervous system in descending order, 
beginning with the cerebral cortex, with unconsciousness progressing to 
anæsthesia. With an overdose, deep anæsthesia progresses to apnea, owing
 to depression of the respiratory center, which is followed by cardiac 
arrest.
	</p>
	<p>
		Barbiturates have rapid onset of action… Desirable barbiturates are 
those that are potent, long-acting, stable in solution, and inexpensive.
 Sodium pentobarbital fits these criteria and is most widely used, 
although others such as secobarbital are acceptable.
	</p>
	<p>
		A primary advantage of barbiturates is speed of action. This effect 
depends on the dose, concentration, and rate of injection. Barbiturates 
induce euthanasia smoothly, with minimal discomfort to the animal…
	</p>
	<p>
		Intravenous injection is necessary for best results, necessitating 
trained personnel… Current federal drug regulations require strict 
accounting for the barbiturates and these must be used under the 
supervision of personnel registered with the US Drug Enforcement 
Administration (DEA).

<p>
	If you want to do it with any benzo shit, just one caution: if take 
them too slowly, there is a chance that you soon will be so out of it 
(as in, too stones) that you won't be able to get round to taking the 
rest. When I first tried to commit suicide it involved diazepam (Valium)
 and after a while I was floating high among the clouds and didn't 
remember a thing till I woke up in hospital next morning.
</p>
<p>
	From what I read in the methods file, you'll need alcohol as well (I think).

<p>
	I took a look at <i>Final Exit,</i> and, according to the author, 
benzos are pretty unreliable without the infamous plastic bag. The best 
way to go out with drugs is through a fast-acting barbituate such as 
Seconal or Nembutal. Phenobarbital is not as good because it is 
slow-acting. The only problem is that it is quite difficult to obtain a 
prescription for Seconal/Nembutal… docs aren't stupid.

	I would think not. I've taken a few too many of those pills before, 
just for fun, and I ended up passing out in a puddle of my own vomit 
behind a movie theatre. I was drunk and high at the time too, but it was
 the caffeine that took me overboard; it was one of the more unpleasant

	The way I managed to get some barbiturates (seconal) was to call a 
psychiatrist and tell him that I was in the process of looking for work 
and and was unable to fall asleep the night before an interview due to 
extreme anxiety which would then lead to my blowing the interview. I had
 tried all of the milder tranquilizers without effect and so needed 
something really strong to knock me out on the night before an 
interview. That way the shrink didn't have to worry that I might become 
dependent on a barbiturate since I'd only be taking it intermittently 
and for a short term. I also told him that I had been prescribed seconal
 for a similar purpose before and had taken it very successfully for 
relief of short-term anxiety without any problems but the doctor who 
prescribed it had since moved his practice. The key to this approach is 
not to reveal any clues to your underlying suicidal ideation and present
 yourself as having no major psychological problems other than 
short-term situational anxiety. The first two shrinks I called with this
 approach were both willing to prescribe it to me. I don't plan to use 
my stash in the near future but felt a desperate need to have the option
 available if and when I choose use it.

	…Some twelve years ago, I tried to off myself… I decided to OD on psychopharmakons.
</p>
<p>
	I was fucking scared though, but reasoned that I could back out any 
time. Funny thing was, after swallowing some 20 of these, all fear 
vanished, and the only thing I felt was an immense joy to finally get 
over with it… and I quickly gulped down the rest of the 100 or so.
</p>
<p>
	What I didn't realize was that you can literally swallow <i>thousands</i>
 of those without dying. Anyway, YMMV but I've found these pills (they 
were meant to fight depression and anxiety in the first place) extremely
 potent to overcome the survival instinct. If your brain works like 
mine, you won't give a damn.

	I understand the carbon monoxide method is the easiest and least 
painful. Beware of the overdose route. If you fail, you get the pleasure
 of having your stomach pumped. That's enough to dissuade almost anyone 
from trying that route again (myself not included). It took three

	The medical books describe an overdose of 25g as being deadly. I took 
about 45g to be on the safe side, in combination with a bottle of vodka.
 Took some sleeping pills, and to my surprise, woke up the next morning 
after approximately hours hours of sleep. My brother called, and after 
hearing my blurred speech, came right over. I was taken to the emergency
 room where they told me my liver was severely dameged and starting to 
turn necrotic (dying off). I refused medical treatment (liver 
transplant) and was allowed to go home to die in my own surroundings. 
They told me I would turn yellow, start vomiting blood, my urine would 
brown, my stool would turn beige, and I would lapse into a coma and die.
 I was happy as a child in a toy store! And all of the above things 
happened, but unfortunately I have a strong body and to the doctor's 
surprise I came out of the coma and my liver regained it's full 
function. But it <b>hurt!</b> I had several liver infarctions and even though I have a high pain threshold it was almost unbearable.

<p>
	At 12:00 AM, on March 29, I took two Dramamine pills, and at 1:00 AM, I
 took twenty-six Ativans (1mg each), thirteen Valiums (10mg each), five 
Carisoprodol/Acetaminophen (2625 mg). I washed down the pills with vodka
 and then put my head inside a plastic bag with a rubber band, leaving a
 little space between the bag and myself. I thought that as I fell 
asleep and became unconsciouss I would lose grip of the band and die by 
asphyxiation. Well, I woke up at 6:00 PM and the plastic bag, the band, 
and even the cap I wore so as not to suck in the plastic bag were all 
inside my closet—apparently I woke up unconsciously and took off the 
bag, band, and the cap, and put them in there. After a while I drank 
some juice and started to vomit; for about ten to fifteen minutes, I 
just couldn't stop. Right now I feel sick, and I'm going to throw up any
 minute now. The bottom line is that the bag-and-band method only works 
with <b>barbiturates!</b> Forget about OTC, Benzos, or sleeping pills that are <i>not</i>
 barbiturates. Right now. I have the wickedest hangover, I feel like 
crap, and want to barf, as if I haven't barfed long enough… Next time 
I'm fucking hanging myself, as pills don't fucking work unless they're 
barbiturates.

		<b>Carbon Monoxide</b>
	</p>
	<p>
		Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odorless gas that is nonflammable
 and nonexplosive until concentrations exceed 10%. It combines with 
hemoglobin to form carboxyhemoglobin and blocks the uptake of oxygen by 
erythrocytes, leading to fatal hypoxemia.
	</p>
	<p>
		In people, the most common symptoms of early CO toxicosis are 
headache, dizziness, and weakness. As concentrations of 
carboxyhemoglobin increase, these signs may be followed by decreased 
visual acuity, tinnitus, nausea, progressive depression, confusion, and 
collapse. Because CO stimulates motor centers in the brain, 
unconsciousness may be accompanied by convulsions and muscular spasms.
	</p>
	<p>
		Carbon monoxide is a cumulative poison. Distinct signs of CO toxicosis
 are not evident until the concentration is 0.05% in air, and acute 
signs do not develop until the concentration is approximately 0.2%. In 
human beings, exposure to 0.32% CO and 0.45% CO for one hour will induce
 unconsciousness and death, respectively…
	</p>
	<p>
		In the past, mass euthanasia has been accomplished by using three 
methods for generating CO: (1) chemical interaction of sodium formate 
and sulfuric acid; (2) exhaust fumes from idling gasoline internal 
combustion engines; and (3) commercially compressed CO in cylinders. The
 first two techniques are associated with a number of problems, such as 
production of other gases, inadequate concentrations of carbon monoxide 
achieved, inadequate cooling of the gas, and maintenance of the 
equipment; therefore, the only recommended source is compressed CO in 
cylinders.
	</p>
	<p>
		Carbon monoxide induces unconsciousness without pain and with minimal 
discernible discomfort. Hypoxemia induced by CO is insidious, so that 
the animal appears to be unaware. (3) Death occurs rapidly if 
concentrations of 4-6% are used.
	</p>
	<p>
		Any electrical equipment exposed to CO (eg, lights and fans) must be explosion proof.

<p>
	<tt>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp; Hi, on the night of July 3rd, I attempted to kill
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt; myself by carbon monoxide poisoning. I skipped
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt; work that day, and bought the garden hose, duct
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt; tape, sleeping pills called "Unisom Sleep-Gels,"
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt; and filled the gas tank to my crappy '81 Mazda 626.</tt>
</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		A garden hose has too small a diameter to be effective, and will melt at high temperatures.
	</li>
	<li>
		Duct tape also melts.
	</li>
	<li>
		Unisom is barely effective as a sleep aid.
	</li>
</ol>
<p>
	Next time, stop in at your local auto-supply store, ask for muffler 
mending tape and a 5' flexible hose for the same. If they ask, tell them
 you work on your car in your garage and don't want CO poisoning :-)
</p>
<p>
	<tt>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp; I parked behind an abandoned building where a
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt; grocery supermarket once was and popped 5 of
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt; those pills. It said one would be good enough…
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt; but i didn't start feeling drowsy until like 30-45
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt; mins later…</tt>
</p>
<p>
	<b>Five</b>? Just five pills isn't much of an attempt :-)
</p>
<p>
	And you forgot the requisite bottle of scotch, as found at all the best suicide scenes.
</p>
<p>
	<tt>&nbsp;&gt;so I started up the engine and I guess I fell asleep.
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt;I think about 10 mins later, I woke up because my
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt;toes and my fingers started to tingle.</tt>
</p>
<p>
	This is a known side effect. Here's where the alcohol comes in: if 
you've ever gotten even close to drunk, you know that booze makes your 
skin numb—thus, no tingling.
</p>
<p>
	<tt>&nbsp;&gt;The feeling bothered me (I was hoping to be passed
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt;out so I wouldn't have to feel it in the first place)
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt;so that frightened me and I turned the ignition off.
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt;Yeah, I chickened out.</tt>
</p>
<p>
	Nothing to be ashamed of.
</p>
<p>
	<tt>&nbsp;&gt; Good thing though… my brother is a diabetic.
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt; So I'm gonna try</tt>
</p>
<p>
	Not very nice for your brother.
</p>
<p>
	<tt>&nbsp;&gt; injecting the insulin into my system on Sunday night
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt; so I could die in my sleep or supposedly when my
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt; family believes I'm sleeping. Unfortunately my
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt; brother won't have any in the morning to use for his
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt; daily shots.</tt>
</p>
<p>
	If you have access to his needles, there's plenty else you can inject 
for a faster demise, and less guilt (or risk from lack of insulin) for 
the brother.
</p>
<p>
	<tt>&nbsp;&gt; But anyways, my suggestion for CO poisoning is to do
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt; anything you can to get passed out so in case that
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt; tingling feeling in your toes and fingers bother
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt; you like it did to me… you won't be conscious to
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt; feel it and then quit with the whole procedure.</tt>
</p>
<p>
	The methods file doesn't have much on CO right now, this would be a 
good addition. It's also been mentioned here that modern gasoline and 
catalytic converters don't send much CO out the tailpile these days.
</p>
<p>
	<tt>&nbsp;&gt; I'm sure a lot of people are gonna poke fun at
		<br>

	<tt>&nbsp;&gt; Now, any chemists out there who know how to rig a CO
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt; generator from household chemicals?</tt>
</p>
<p>
	The two easiest ways to make CO are:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		Adding formic acid to hot, concentrated sulfuric acid.
	</li>
	<li>
		Heating a mixture of calcium carbonate and zinc.
	</li>
</ol>
<dl>
	<dt>
		<b>Method 1</b>
	</dt>
	<dd>
		The sulfuric acid removes H<sub>2</sub>O from the formic acid, leaving CO-gas.
	</dd>
	<dd>
		<blockquote>
			HCOOH -&gt; H<sub>2</sub>O + CO
		</blockquote>
	</dd>
	<dd>
		To create one mole of CO-gas, you need 46g of formic acid (assuming 
complete reaction) and at least 100g of concentrated sulfuric acid. As 
the sulfuric acid is dilluted by the water created by the reaction, you 
need more than 100g of sulfuric acid, so the reaction doesn't stop. The 
formic acid and sulfuric acid should be concentrated to speed up the 
reaction.
	</dd>
	<dt>
		<b>Method 2</b>
	</dt>
	<dd>
		The calcium carbonate reacts with the zinc, giving calcium oxide, zinc oxide, and CO gas.
	</dd>
	<dd>
		<blockquote>
			CaCO3 + Zn -&gt; CaO + ZnO + CO
		</blockquote>
	</dd>
	<dd>
		To create one mole of CO-gas, you need 100g CaCO3 and 65.3g Zn 
(assuming complete reaction). The zinc and calcium carbonate should be 
finely powdered and well-mixed to speed up the reaction.
	</dd>
	<dd>
		One mole of gas fills up 22.4 cubic decimeters (22.4 liters). You you 
should have a concentration of at least 1% CO in the air to kill 
yourself. It's probably a good idea to collect the CO in a bag. Just 
make sure you don't have too much leakage.

<p>
	<tt>&nbsp;&gt; An article in The Times (UK) 17 June 1998…
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt; I'll paraphrase, with inserted comments as appropriate:
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt;
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt; "Catalytic converters reduce car suicides…
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt; The growing use of cat. converters in car exhaust
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt; systems has led to a sharp decline in suicide rates
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt; among men in the 1990s…
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt; One of the authors said she believed that the
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt; introduction of cats had led to the biggest
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt; change in British suicide patterns since the
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt; replacement of poisonous coal gasoline with
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt; non-toxic natural gas in the 1970's, which
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt; was also followed by a substantial drop in
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt; the number of suicides."
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt;
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt; Well, despite the article's shaky scientific
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt; postulating, this gives an interesting twist to
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt; the debate about whether or not CO emissions are
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt; reduced from cars with catalytic converters;
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt; several posters in the past have indicated that
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt; cats merely reduce other emissions, and that CO is
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt; still at the same level whether it be a new car
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt; or an old one.
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt;
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt; Has anyone out there any information on this?
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt; Is the article actually misleading us (by acting
		<br>

	…As to getting around the catalytic converter: can't you destroy the 
efficacy of the catalyst by putting leaded gasoline in the car? The 
nozzles for regular leaded gas won't fit in the fuel intake (in the 
U.S., at least), but it is easy enough to buy a gas can and fill 'er up a
 few times.
</p>
<p>
	Or, another easy method: Put the car on jacks; crawl under with a 
hacksaw or pipe-cutter, and saw through the exhaust just ahead of the 
catalytic converter (it's roughly square, ahead of the muffler). Of 
course, it's <u>illegal</u> to bypass your car's emissions-control system, but…

		<br>
		&nbsp;Date: 19 Jun 98 11:16:55 -0400</tt>
</p>
<p>
	It's time for me to eat some humble pie. After my many adamant statements that catalytic converters do <i>nothing</i> to reduce emissions of carbon monoxide, I have found two sources that contradict that assertion.
</p>
<p>
	Catalytic converters became mandatory on US cars begining with the 1975 model year and UK cars with the 1993 model year.
</p>
<p>
	The first source is from the US Environmental Protection 
Administration. On the link (below) they explain the goal of reducing CO
 emissions from autos by catalytic converters. They state that "Today's 
passenger cars are capable of emitting 90 percent less carbon monoxide 
over their lifetimes than their uncontrolled counterparts of the 
1960's." Sounds like they're doing something there, huh? Let me explain.
 Over the projected life of a modern car the total CO produced may be a 
little more than half the total CO produced a 1960's car.
</p>
<p>
	What does this have to do with catalytic converters? First check the 
EPA site, then I'll direct you to a more specific and detailed site.
</p>
<p>
	<a href="http://www.epa.gov/OMSWWW/03-co.htm">http://www.epa.gov/OMSWWW/03-co.htm</a>
</p>
<p>
	Wayne State University School of Medicine has a site called the Carbon 
Monoxide Headquarters. It's a very informative site, here's the address 
for the home page:
</p>
<p>
	<a href="http://www.phymac.med.wayne.edu/FacultyProfile/penney/COHQ/co1.htm">http://www.phymac.med.wayne.edu/FacultyProfile/penney/COHQ/co1.htm</a>
</p>
<p>
	Following the links from the home page will give you information such 
as, US vehicles with catalytic converters produce about the same amount 
of CO exhaust before a tune up as vehicles without catalytic converters 
produce after a tune up.
</p>
<p>
	This link shows just how long it takes to develop lethal levels of CO 
in vehicles with catalytic converters. Depending upon the efficiency of 
the combustion it takes up to 16 minutes. There are many variables, 
check out the site:
</p>
<p>
	<a href="http://www.phymac.med.wayne.edu/FacultyProfile/penney/COHQ/COMotoVeh/cosuicide3.htm">http://www.phymac.med.wayne.edu/FacultyProfile/penney/COHQ/COMotoVeh/cosuicide3.htm</a>
</p>
<p>
	…and they have a very pretty picture illustrating CO concentrations in cars, when used for suicide at this site:
</p>
<p>
	<a href="http://www.phymac.med.wayne.edu/FacultyProfile/penney/COHQ/COMotoVeh/cosuicide2.htm">http://www.phymac.med.wayne.edu/FacultyProfile/penney/COHQ/COMotoVeh/cosuicide2.htm</a>
</p>
<p>
	You can also follow links from the home page for informtion on charcoal
 briquettes (much more lethal than I would have guessed) and other 
sources of CO.
</p>
<p>
	To sum up, <u>I was wrong</u>. I was wrong when I said that catalytic 
converters are not designed to reduce carbon monoxide emissions, but CO 
from car exhaust is an effective means of committing suicide. Running 
the engine out of tune, defeating the oxygen sensor, setting the choke 
to "on," making the fuel/air mixture richer, using this method during 
cold or moist weather or just waiting a few extra minutes will all 
compensate for the marginal effect of the catalytic converter.
</p>
<p>
	In my defense, I will say that <i>none</i> of the sites I found by 
searching "catalytic converters" said that they reduce anything but 
oxides of nitrogen, but I apologize to all for my prior, innacurate 
postings. I do feel bad about giving out innaccurate information and I 
will try and do more research on defeating the oxygen sensor and 
adjusting the mix in vehicles with fuel injection.

<p>
	Any car would produce the necessary CO, the only question is how long 
would it take. You can speed it up by making the mixture richer and by 
defeating the oxygen sensor.
</p>
<p>
	An easy way to test things is by buying a $30 carbon monoxide detector 
and reading the documentation to see what concentration it alerts at. 
Test your system, wait for the alert, then do the math to figure how 
long it would take you to get to the desired level.
</p>
<p>
	Here are some links you can use to compute lethal levels, the bottom 
line is that a concentration of 6400 parts per million will kill in 25 
minutes. You might also consider other sources of CO.

	You can experiment with the method by wrapping a cord around your neck 
just below the jaw and pulling it tight. You will first feel pressure 
because the veins are blocked before the arteries-thus you are blocking 
the return flow initially. If the cord is tight enough, it will also 
block the arteries supplying blood to the brain.

		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt;&gt;I have done some experimenting with it and I Think
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt;&gt;that it will work quite well. All that is needed
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt;&gt;is a plastic bag the size of a tall kitchen trash
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt;&gt;bag (or a little larger), a large rubber band (one
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt;&gt;that is big enough to go over your head but still
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt;&gt;be fairly tight around your neck), and a can of
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt;&gt;engine starting fluid (ether).</tt>
</p>
<p>
	How pure is the ether in the "engine starting fluid"? I would not be suprised if it was adulterated to prevent "huffing."
</p>
<p>
	<tt>&nbsp;&gt;&gt;The rubber band is placed around the openong of
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt;&gt;the plastic bag. With the band in place around
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt;&gt;the opening of the bag. Squirt a fairly large
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt;&gt;quantity of the ether into the bag.</tt>
</p>
<p>
	You might consider soaking the ether into a rag rather than just pouring it on to the bag.
</p>
<p>
	Also consider that ether is a powerful solvent- it'd be pretty shitty 
to wake up with a bad headache and a plastic bag permanently melted on 
to your face and hair.
</p>
<p>
	<tt>&nbsp;&gt;&gt; I would prefer to be lying down, dressed as I
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt;&gt;want to be found. Then I'd simply slip the
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt;&gt;ether-filled bag over my head. I beleive that
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt;&gt;the ether will put you to sleep rather quickly.
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt;&gt;And once I am asleep, I will suffocate (probably
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt;&gt;without even feeling it). Is this correct? Comments, please!
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt;Yes. For one thing, your way will not be painless.</tt>
</p>
<p>
	Says you. Ether was routinely used for anethesia until the <b>long-term</b>
 dangers became known. If it can keep you from noticing that your leg is
 being sawn off, It should be just fine for keeping you from noticing 
that you are permanently out of oxygen.
</p>
<p>
	<tt>&nbsp;&gt;First, the ether will corrode your nose walls,
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt;eyes and lungs.
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt;Second, you won't fall asleep before you suffocate.</tt>
</p>
<p>
	Why don't you grab a can of ether and some plastic bags, then report back to us?
</p>
<p>
	<tt>&nbsp;&gt;Third, you won't suffocate. You will drown as your
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt;auto-neurosystems force your lungs to breathe
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt;the ether.</tt>
</p>
<p>
	True. Perhaps he needs a bigger bag?
</p>
<p>
	<tt>&nbsp;&gt;Fourth, yor body won't look too good. Bloated,
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt;swollen, and with a horrible twisted grin on your face.</tt>

<p>
	The subject of physiological effects of inert gases has come up. 
Accidents in the industry that I have read about suggest that breathing 
pure nitrogen leads to extremely rapid unconsciousness. One or two 
breaths effectively purge all the oxygen out of the lungs, and the 
victim doesn't have time to react. There are probably no warning 
symptoms, as nitrogen has no physiological effects of its own.
</p>
<p>
	One story is that a man entered a large nitrogen tank to clean it, not 
knowing that it had not been purged with air. He collapsed immediately, 
and his brother (a fellow worker) attempted to rescue him. Both were 
found dead of anoxia.
</p>
<p>
	I would think that death from nitrogen inhalation would be quick (5-10 
min.), painless, and uneventful. (No convulsions, no gasping for air, 
etc). Obviously, I haven't tried it, so I can't say for sure. Helium and
 argon would be expected to have very similar effects.

<p>
	You fill an enclosed space with nitrogen and just sit there. The nitrogen displaces the CO<sub>2 </sub>in
 your lungs, preventing you from feeling what you feel when you hold 
your breath for a long time. You simply pass out, and die of 
asphyxiation while you're unconscious. I've heard it's rather pleasant.

		</dd>
		<dd>
			Ringing up is preferable to a personal visit because…
			<ul>
				<li>
					If you are a nervous sort of person like me, then a phone is much 
better tham a personal call (from a "nobody knows who I am" 
point-of-view).
				</li>
				<li>
					You will find that most party shops don't supply helium, so it's a good idea to ring around.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				When you find a shop that can supply the helium, they'll ask if you 
want a helium canister for about twenty balloons, or a helium tank for 
about two-hundred. Naturally, you'll want to plump for the latter.
			</p>
			<p>
				The gas itself will cost about #45, and you must also place a 
deposit on the cylinder; the deposit will need to be cash (i.e., not 
switch card or credit card), and it'll probably be around #50. 
Fortunately, I'm well off, so money is not a problem here.
			</p>
			<p>
				Note that, the party shops will not usually have any helium to buy 
"off the shelf," and they may ask you to wait from one to ten days for 
some to be delivered. If time is a constraint, then this could be a 
problem.
			</p>
			<p>
				The gas appears to be "balloon-grade" and exceeds 99% purity. The 
remaining fraction is probably nitrogen, though I've no idea really.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Caution:</b> The gas tank is actually quite heavy (about the same
 as two or three car batteries), so if you are in any way disabled, you 
may have trouble with it.
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				Neighbour: "So what on Earth do you want all this gas for?"
				<br>
				You: "Oh, I'm going to gas myself. Would you mind just helping me get it up the stairs, please?"
			</blockquote>
		</dd>
		<dt>
			<b>Making a Gas Mask</b>
		</dt>
		<dd>
			Your first stop should be a trip to the local "auto spares" shop, or 
"Boots," where you can get a siphoning tube, or any other suitable 
flexible tubing. I would recommend a longer piece rather than a shorter 
one because
			<ul>
				<li>
					The gas is quite cold when it comes out of the tank, and a long 
tube will give it a chance to warm up by a couple of degrees.
				</li>
				<li>
					If you use a very long tube, there's a slight chance you may get 
tangled up in it, and accidently trip over and choke yourself to death 
on it.
				</li>
				<li>
					You can always make a long piece shorter if you're not happy with it.
				</li>
			</ul>
			About three metres should be plenty, and will cost under #1 per metre.
			<p>
				Next stop: the supermarket. Buy a tub of "I Can't Believe It's Not 
Butter." Not the very small-sized tub, but the next size up. If you 
remember when you were a kid, you might have stuck a glass over your 
mouth, and sucked, and the suction would have held the glass to your 
face, airtight. We will use the same principle with the butter tub. 
Hence you want to get one which will fit under your chin, over your 
mouth and up to the bridge of your nose.
			</p>
			<p>
				Any container of about this size will do, however I would recommend 
the use of "I Can't Believe It's Not Butter," "Utterly Butterly," or 
"Clover," as they come in quite strong plastic tubs, unlike "Flora" or 
"Happy Shopper's Own Brand Marga-Muck," which have thin plastic, which 
could crack or split when being cut.
			</p>
			<p>
				Treat yourself to a slap-up meal of toast and butter, and then give 
the margarine-tub a good cleaning, unless you are a girl, in which case 
you probably like having oily slimy stuff all over your face (margarine 
contains active lipobuttersomes—in scientific tests eight out of ten 
phlegm weevils got younger when they used it, etc., etc.).
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				NB: I don't want anyone else to use an "I Can't Believe It's Not 
Butter" tub, as I want to be the first person to kill myself using one. 
That would be an achievment worthy of some praise.
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				Fit the tub over your mouth, you'll find that your nose gets in the 
way, and prevents an airtight fit. Use a sharp knife—preferably an 
X-Acto or carpet/utility knife—to cut a small indentation where your 
nose will go. Make lots of small cuts, rather than one big one, because 
you're less likely to make a serious bodge. When the tub fits snugly 
over your mouth, you should be able to hold it there by sucking in. It 
doesn't matter if it isn't a perfect airtight fit, because the helium 
gas will fill the mask easily, and as long as the %Oxygen is kept low, 
then a little air getting in won't matter. If the helium pressure is 
sufficiently strong, it'll force out any air anyway.
			</p>
			<p>
				Next, get some long elastic bands. Find a sharp object about the 
size and shape of a knitting needle, and puncture a hole in the sides of
 the tub on each side, about in line with where your ears are. I found 
that heating a knitting needle and punching a small hole made a clean 
edge. Chain two or three long elastic bands together, and push one end 
through the hole. Once it's through, pull enough through the hole to let
 you tie a large knot in the elastic band, and then pull the band back 
through. The elastic band should now be held firmly to the tub. Repeat 
this procedure on the other side. And you can now place the tub over 
your mouth, and put the elastic bands around the head. Adjust the 
tightness (by tieing knots in the elastic band, or pulling more throuth 
the tub holes), so that it fits snugly and comfortably. If you've got 
the placement just right, the elastic bands can be placed around the 
ears, and the mask will hold in place very comfortably and easily and 
will not fall off.
			</p>
			<p>
				After that, take the tubing, and note how wide it is. On the front 
of the mask, about in line with the nose or mouth, using the sharp 
knife, make two incisions about the same diameter as the tubing. Don't 
cut a hole, just make a cross shaped cut. Now push the tubing through 
from the inside of the mask, and the cut pieces of plastic will open out
 and form a flange around the tubing. Pull the tubing through until a 
small piece is left protruding into the mask, (not too far). Now tape 
the flanges of plastic to the tubing, and liberally wind more tape 
around the join until the tubing is firmly held and the seal is 
airtight.
			</p>
			<p>
				Finally, tape the free end of the tube to the gas outlet of the 
helium tank. This may be a problem because the gas tanks that are 
supplied for filling balloons have an unusual outlet. It consists of a 
spring-loaded nozzle, which when bent, opens a valve to allow the gas 
out. Imagine holding a balloon onto a nozzle and then twisting your 
wrist upwards, this forces a plunger backwards and releases gas into the
 balloon, the gas comes out rather quickly, filling the balloon in a 
matter of seconds. When the nozzle is released, the spring forces the 
nozzle back to the horizontal position, and the metal plunger slides 
back against a stop, cutting off the gas flow. There is a master valve 
on the top of the cylinder too, but it doesn't allow for much flow 
regulation.
			</p>
			<p>
				This odd nozzle arrangement can act for and against us. I ought to 
point out, that I have managed to get (through work), a proper gas 
regulator valve, so I've replaced the one on my cylinder, but I did some
 experimentation with the spring loaded nozzle version first. If you 
tape the tubing to the nozzle, and then connect some more elastic bands 
between the nozzle end and a sturdy object (like the cylinder handle), 
you can make a nice "dead mans handle:" when you let go of the nozzle, 
the elastic band pulls the nozzle upwards, and releases gas. This means 
that you can hold the nozzle in a position which just lets enough gas 
out, into the mask, and causes you to lose conciousness, when you pass 
out, your hand will release the nozzle, and the elastic band will open 
it up even more, thus increasing the gas flow, and ensuring that you 
don't get any air. Experimentation has shown this to be quite a good 
little system.
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				NB: Don't be tempted to remove the nozzle, and then open the master 
valve, as the gas comes out at a tremendous speed; it will make the most
 amazing noise, and make you jump right out of your skin (it will also 
blow any papers anywhere in the room all over). Only open the master 
valve, when you have a suitable regulator or nozzle in place (hey! you 
might even get yourself killed!).
			</blockquote>
		</dd>
		<dt>
			<b>Gassing Yourself</b>
		</dt>
		<dd>
			The fact that I'm writing this is evidence enough that I'm a chicken 
and haven't succeeded in killing myself yet. I've no particular reason 
to die, just bored with life, so there is no urgency on my part, and one
 day I'll go through with it. However I can tell you what you will feel 
using the inert gas method, and I can reassure you that it is not 
painful.
			<p>
				The bag-over-the-head method causes a build-up of CO<sub>2</sub>, 
and the body will react with gasping, rapid pulse, and general panic 
(I've tried it); the inert gas method simply replaces the air with an 
inert atmosphere, denuded of oxygen, and the body has no "learned" 
response to this.
			</p>
			<p>
				Once you have the mask in place and the gas flowing (I'd advise 
tunring the gas on first, arranging your valve regulation, and then 
putting on the mask, because the first gush of gas can be a bit violent,
 and might feel unpleasant), all you have to do is breathe normally. 
When you breathe the gas in pure, you'll notice that it is…
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					…quite cold, but not too unpleasant (a longer tube may help);
				</li>
				<li>
					…essentially odourless, though it smells different; from room air;
				</li>
				<li>
					…makes your voice squeaky—try singing as you die!
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				After maybe three long slow breaths, you may notice a slight 
increase in your heart rate. I can only speculate about this, but it's 
almost certainly due to one or more of the following:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					perhaps it's one's body's way of saying, "More oxygen, please."
				</li>
				<li>
					anxiety—after all, you <i>are</i> trying to kill yourself!
				</li>
				<li>
					some trace material in the gas (though this is unlikely);
				</li>
				<li>
					<i>[Insert better reason here.]</i>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				I found that the momentary racing heart passed quickly, and I 
conclude that it was caused by anxiety (on successive experiments, I've 
found the effect to be less pronounced).
			</p>
			<p>
				After about thirty seconds you will start to feel pressure in your 
head. Not really, but if you have stood up quickly, and feel dizzy, 
you'll know that there's this stange feeling "inside" your head. This 
has been explained to me by a colleague, as probably being caused by the
 blood vessels in the head expanding to increase the blood flow and try 
to keep oxygen levels up.
			</p>
			<p>
				After a few more seconds, you'll start to feel yourself black out. I
 was unable to verify exactly what you "see" because my gas mask, comes 
just up to my eyes, so I keep them shut whilst doing this. However on 
previous experiments, just breathing directly from the tube, I've found 
that my vision started to go black around the edges, and that is 
entirely consistent with symptoms caused by low oxygen.
			</p>
			<p>
				At this point on all attempts, I have removed the mask, and prayed 
that an aircraft would crash land on my house and spare me having to do 
this any more.
			</p>
		</dd>
		<dt>
			<b>Conclusions</b>
		</dt>
		<dd>
			Keeping the mask on for a few more seconds would almost certainly 
have resulted in unconsciousness; having the gas mask in place would 
have meant a continued period without oxygen (and thus death, after a 
few minutes), under these circumstances.
			<p>
				The entire process seems to be essentially painless. You will feel 
yourself blacking out, and this causes me some panic, and hence that 
abortion of the operation, but I beleive persons with a stronger will 
should have no difficulty in carrying the plan through to terminus. (The
 person who initially suggested the use of helium to me, has not 
contacted me for some time, and since I have only an email address, I 
cannot ascertain why, but is quite possibly dead from this method).
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				<b>Side effects:</b> To date I have nearly succeeded on several attempts, and have suffered no (known) long term effects.
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				Since people can black out from standing up too quickly—the air 
force g-tests pilots by whirling them around in centrifuges, drawing the
 blood away from the head until they black out—and blackouts can be 
caused by numerous other means. I beleive that if oxygen is restored 
quickly, then any "aborted operations" should be fairly safe.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Pros of this Method:</b> It appears to be painless, and can be 
carried out in the comfort of your own home, at your own pace, allowing 
the opportunity to get comfortable, have a last drink, put your favorite
 record on, etc., etc.
			</p>
			<p>
				Definitely a nice way to go.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Cons of this Method:</b> If you jump off a tall building, then 
you just need to make that decision once. Once your feet have left the 
ledge, you're history, and there's no turning back (assuming a good 
landing anyway). With the gassing method, you have about a minute to sit
 there trying to convince yourself that you want to live really, and 
it's very hard to quiet those demons.
			</p>
			<p>
				I would dearly love to get my hands on some nitrous oxide, as this 
would have an anæsthetizing effect, whilst acheiving asphyxiation.

	It was indeed easy to obtain a large tank from a party shop. I also 
bought three-hundred balloons to make it more credible. Made the 
gasmask/garden-hose contraption; no problems there, either (bought a 
mask from a DIY store for paint fumes). Did the thing with the nozzle, 
worked fine (although I also had a friend there with me to help me with 
that). Had a lot of drinks, some Valium, and some sleeping pills 
(prescription), put on some music and got into bed. Put on the mask, 
turned on the gas (which was a bit cold but who cares), felt somewhat 
lightheaded, saw the black rings around my eyes, felt a choking 
sensation, and passed out. Because my friend was there with me, she 
described what happened next. It is not true that your brain doesn't 
realise the lack of oxygen. Even though I was passed out I started 
furiously clawing at the mask to get it off. It was on tight, and my 
friend tried to keep me from clawing, but apparently I opened my eyes 
wide and was panicking because of the choking. I don't remember this 
because this was an unconscious reflex. In the end I managed to get the 
mask off, was unconscious for about forty-five minutes, and came to in a
 wet bed—I had wet myself. I did suffer some temporary brain damage; 
visual disturbances, forgetfullness, impaired speech, incomprehensable 
sentences etc. I tried it again three more times and the exact same 
thing happened. My explanation is, that in the end subconscious reflexes
 take over. Believe me, I wanted to die… I had already painted my 
coffin!

<p>
	I have some problems with using helium or nitrogen with the 
garbage-bag-rubber-band method. Mainly, I wonder about gas build-up: you
 open the valve on your gas cylinder, hold the end of the hose from the 
tank up by your face, pull the garbage bag over your head, and snap the 
rubber bands in place around your neck (all while sedated and/or drunk, 
to suppress any panic reaction).
</p>
<p>
	Assuming you get a nice, tight fit with the rubber bands over the 
bunched-up plastic band at your neck, the bag inflates quickly with the 
inert gas and you rapidly pass out. Then what? The gas keeps pouring 
into the bag, with no way out; is the bag eventually going to rupture at
 a seam, or snap rubber bands? Will that happen (in a worst case 
scenario) <i>after</i> brain damage has occured, but <i>before</i> death?
</p>
<p>
	I can think of ways to stop the gas flow, or vent the gas, but they're 
complicated (and that increases the risk of failure). I think the 
nitrogen tent method deals with these problems, and it's also, imho, a 
more comfortable exit. I pieced together my tent with heavy (4 mil.) 
plastic sheeting, taped over a box, but I have worked out a simpler 
method:
</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
		Buy a heavy-duty trash bin liner, the kind intended for 50-55 galln 
drums, used as trash cans at parks, sporting arenas, etc. These are 
larger than usual garbage bags, are usually transparent, and are made 
out of a stronger plastic (similar to that used for plastic grocery 
bags). They can be purchased at a good hardware store or janitorial 
supply store.
	</p>
	<p>
		Get a sturdy cardboard box, large enough to acomodate your head (and 
maybe your shoulders —to be comfortable), but not too large to fit 
inside the trash bin liner. Place the box inside the bag (I'd place a 
pillow inside the box, first). This is your "tent."
	</p>
	<p>
		Place the tent on a bed, with the open end of the bag (and box) 
pointed toward the foot of the bed. Run a hose from the nitrogen or 
helium gas cylinder up inside the bag, into the box.
	</p>
	<p>
		Place a <i>heavy</i> blanket or quilt over the open end of the bag, 
overlapping the end by several inches. It's important that it be heavy, 
because this is the seal—it will allow excess gas to vent out, while 
preventing fresh air from seaping back in. Use duct tape to tape the 
edge of the blanket to the bag.
	</p>
	<p>
		The tent is ready to go. Open the valve on the gas cylinder's pressure
 regulator, sending gas into the tent. Take a deep breath and slide up 
from the foot of the bed, under the blanket and into the tent, and lie 
with your head inside the box as the tent is flooded with nitrogen or 
helium.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Technical Details</b> (sort of):
	</p>
	<p>
		The goal is to get the oxygen levels inside the tent below 6%, and to keep it down long enough for brain death to occur.
	</p>
	<p>
		<i>[ed. note: there are easily-procured analysis machines which would indicate the oxygen level.]</i>
	</p>
	<p>
		At atmospheric oxygen levels of 4-6%, coma ocurs in 40 seconds, 
followed by convulsions, respiratory arrest and death, according to <a href="http://www.cganet.com/pubs/free/sb-2.htm">Safety Bulletin SB-2</a> from the <a href="http://www.cganet.com/">Compressed Gas Association</a>.
	</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
	Nitrogen is available from welding supply stores; common cylinder sizes
 are 75, 150, 250 cubic feet. The tanks and regulators can be purchased 
or rented (the cost is about the same either way).
</p>
<p>
	You <i>will</i> need a pressure regulator, to reliably control the rate of flow of gas into the tent.
</p>
<p>
	I was advised by a compressed gas expert (I won't mention him by name, 
but thanks!) to use a flow rate of 10 cu. ft. per minute in my 4.5 
cu.ft. tent; I think a somewhat lower rate would be fine, and would give
 me a longer flow (that's not important with a 150 or 250 cu. ft. tank, 
but might be with a smaller tank). In animal euthanasia tests, the flow 
rate was reported as approx. 40% of the volume of the compartment per 
minute—do the math for your own tent.
</p>
<p>
	Is it painful or unpleasant? Nitrogen asphyxiation has been recommended
 as the ultimate humane method for criminal executions—"Killing With 
Kindness," by Stuart A. Creque (<i>National Review,</i> Sept. 11, 1995),
 describes a couple of accidental nitrogen asphyxiations, in which the 
victims apperantly never realized what was happening. In animal 
euthanasia experiments, hyperventilation prior to loss of consciousness 
was reported, which might be distressing, and muscular tremors, 
convulsions and "vocalizations" after loss of consciousness.

</p>
<dl>
	<dt>
		I have run a couple of tests with my tent:
	</dt>
	<dd>
		Firstly, I have simply lain in the tent, just to see how long it would take for CO<sub>2 </sub>build-up
 to occur, assuming it would happen at all. I was able to stay inside my
 4.5 cu. ft. tent for up to 45 minutes, before my breathing became so 
labored that it was uncomfortable (distracting, really). It also got 
rather warm inside the tent, especially with a heavy quilt on it, and 
there was a considerable build-up of moisture on the inside of the tent,
 from my respiration. Not really bothersome, given the short time I'll 
be in it (alive, anyway) when I use it.
		<p>
			I also tested the tent by placing two lit votive candles inside, 
placing a small, low-pressure (7.5 cu.ft.) cannister of helium for party
 balloons inside, and opening the valve. The candles dimmned and went 
out in approximately 90 seconds.
		</p>
		<p>
			I later vented the remainder of the small helium tank into the tent 
while I was in it—enough to raise the pitch of my voice, but not to even
 make me light-headed. One shortcoming of these tests was that I had no 
way to accurately judge how much helium had actually been put into the 
tent, and another is that I do not know whether the oxygen levels 
necesary to support combustion by the candles is as low as that necesary
 to remain alive.
		</p>
		<p>
			I do not think the small canisters of helium sold for filling 25-30 
party balloons are sufficient to "safely" carry out this method; the 
larger tanks should be used.

</p>
<p>
	You have slightly different ideas than I. I'd simply fill the garbage 
bag up with helium (while keeping it closed), and, once full, would the 
influx of gas; then I'd put it over my head, and duct-tape it on 
(actually, before putting it over my head, I'd start the oxygen 
deprivation with some nitrous oxide). This way, you don't have to worry 
about pressures changing and whatnot. As helium rises nicely, one should
 be able to not lose much helium while putting it over ones head, and 
with a good exhale before putting it on, hopefully the CO<sub>2 </sub>should not be a problem.
</p>
<p>
	…I think that a couple of the smaller containers would be fine for the 
solo garbage bag. However, your idea seems quite thought out and 
workable, merely requiring a larger expenditure of effort and money. I 
think that both are about as likely to work (I plan on sometime buying a
 garbage bag and testing about how long that I can breath in it before 
CO<sub>2 </sub>build up becomes a problem (altho I'm guessing it would 
take longer without a temporary source of O2, and thus continued 
respiration) tho I'd imagine that it would take at least 15 minutes for a
 decently sized garbage bag).

		&nbsp;&gt;&gt; Geo Stone's method talks about flushing the tent
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt;&gt; once, and then sealing its ends. So a small
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt;&gt; (or smallest) cylinder should be sufficient.
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt;&gt;
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt;&gt;&gt;…how do we know that we have the level of oxygen
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt;&gt;&gt; low enough at sufficient amount of time.
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt;&gt;
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt;&gt; Again I think that Hermotimus' idea is better than
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt;&gt; Geo Stone's tube tent. If you just flush the
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt;&gt; cylinder inside the tent, heck, what about the
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt;&gt; pressure build-up inside?
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt;
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt; …I don't share the trust in Herm's small tent
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt; method. I appreciate Herm's knowledgeable research
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt; but the one point I don't agree with Herm is the
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt; risk for screwing up the method by convulsions.
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt; The muscular strength in convulsions, I imagine, could
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt; be very strong, and therefore I personally do not
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt; feel Herm's method is reliable. That is just my
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt; impression. In a tent, however, I feel that one
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt; could have one's convulsions pretty freely without
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt; risking to rupture the tent. Even moreso in a car,
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt; I guess.
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt;
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt; I recall that we must be at 75% concentration or
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt; above and for sufficient amount of time, according
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt; to Stone's chapter on gases. How would we be sure
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt; of that? Maybe it is obvious to a gas expert that
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt; one would be, but I don't feel certain at this stage.
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt; I recall that oxygen has a tendency to leak into
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt; any space from which you take it away and i dont
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt; know how strongly or quickly this happens.
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt;
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt; Herm's posting about the two guys in the truck was
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt; very interesting. We should be at a very
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt; interesting suicide method here if it is correct
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt; that they were so peacefully put to sleep. We don't
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt; know what these guys had premedicated with, though.
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt; I mean, they could have been on some street drugs,
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt; as well, as they sat down to enjoy the laughing gas.
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt;
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt; By the way how do we really know they were not out
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt; to suicide? If they would have had laughing gas,
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt; that would have caused the same end result, I
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt; assume, since that must be another form of oxygen
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt; deprivation. Thus they should have also been able
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt; to figure. However, I don't hold it unlikely that they
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt; were just out for a rush on laughing gas—but how
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt; does anyone know? Any clues in the article here?</tt>

	<b>Re: tube tents.</b>
	<br>
	<i>Mea culpa</i>—thought they were common knowledge; obviously I was 
wrong. Anyhow, these are cylindrical plastic bags, open at both ends, 
that are used as emergency tents by backpackers. They're flimsy (about 
like thick trash bags), airtight, and thus not very good for keeping dry
 (due to condensation), but they are light and cheap ($5-10). Since 
there is generally a rope running its length and keeping it from 
falling, and a person on the bottom, the approximate shape (in use) is 
triangular.
</p>
<p>
	If the tube tent is 8 feet [244 cm] long and has a diameter of 4 feet 
[122 cm] the triangular volume is about 55 cubic feet [1.5 cubic meters]
 or about 400 gallons.
</p>
<p>
	Hermotimus made the valid point that you want to vent surplus gas 
without tearing the bag/tent and that a rug over the tent was a 
reasonable way to achieve this. The problem is that since the standard 
tube tent is only 8 feet long, there may not be sufficient room for a 
person to stretch out and still have enough bag at either end to fold 
over with a rug flap. A couple of possible work-arounds are (1) two tube
 tents (end-to-end) attached by duct tape; (2) cut a hole near the top 
of one side of the tube tent, and make a weighted flap that vents excess
 gas and then falls back in place. Gravity should work fine, but I 
haven't tried this and you may want to experiment with petroleum jelly 
(Vaseline) or velcro to make a better seal.

	<b>Re: deaths due to nitrogen on airplanes (and elsewhere).</b>
	<br>
	The point has nothing to do with airplanes per se, or the circumstances
 under which nitrogen was mistakenly used. The point (consistent with 
other accidental human deaths, as well as intentional animal deaths) is 
that nitrogen asphyxia seems to be a very low-trauma way to go.

	<br>
	&nbsp;From <a href="http://netvet.wustl.edu/org/awic/bib/avmaeuth.htm">http://netvet.wustl.edu/org/awic/bib/avmaeuth.htm</a>:
</p>
<blockquote cite="http://netvet.wustl.edu/org/awic/bib/avmaeuth.htm">
	<p>
		At concentrations of 30% to 40% CO<sub>2 </sub>in oxygen, anæsthesia 
was induced within 1 to 2 minutes, usually without struggling, retching,
 or vomiting. …In cats, inhalation of 60% CO<sub>2 </sub>results in loss of consciousness within 45 seconds, and respiratory arrest within 5 minutes.
	</p>
	<p>
		Several investigators have suggested that inhalation of high concentrations of CO<sub>2 </sub>may
 be distressing to animals because of mucosal irritation and ventilatory
 stimulation. However, the degree of distress appears to be mild, and it
 is unlikely that it is any more than inhalation of volatile 
anæsthetics…
	</p>
	<p>
		Carbon dioxide is used for preslaughter anæsthesia of swine. The undesirable side effect of CO<sub>2</sub>,
 as used in commercial slaughterhouses, is that swine experience a stage
 of excitement with vocalization for about 40 seconds before they lose 
consciousness. For that reason, CO<sub>2 </sub>preslaughter anæsthesia may appear less humane than other techniques.
	</p>
	<p>
		Carbon dioxide may be purchased… in solid state as "dry ice,"… [which]
 is inexpensive, nonflammable, and nonexplosive… [and] does not result 
in accumulation of tissue residues in food-producing animals. …does not 
distort cellular architecture.
	</p>
	<p>
		Because CO<sub>2 </sub>is heavier than air, incomplete filling of a 
chamber may permit tall or climbing animals to avoid exposure and to 
survive. This appears to be very distressful to the animals. Some 
species may have extraordinary tolerance for CO<sub>2</sub>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Compressed CO<sub>2 </sub>gas in cylinders is preferable to dry ice 
because the inflow to the chamber can be regulated precisely. If dry ice
 is used, animal contact must be avoided to prevent freezing or 
chilling. Carbon dioxide generated by other methods such as from a fire 
extinguisher or from chemical means (eg, Alka-Seltzer) are unacceptable.
 With an animal in the chamber, an optimal flow rate should displace at 
least 20% of the chamber volume per minute. Unconsciousness may be 
induced more rapidly by exposing animals to a CO<sub>2 </sub>concentration
 of 70% or more by prefilling the chamber. It is important to verify 
that an animal is dead before removing it from the chamber. If an animal
 is not dead, CO<sub>2 </sub>narcosis must be followed with another 
method of euthanasia. Larger animals, such as rabbits, cats, and swine, 
appear to be more distressed by CO<sub>2 </sub>euthanasia; therefore, other methods of euthanasia are preferable.

	It's legal, but most companies won't sell tanks of it to residential addresses unless there's a <i>damned</i> good excuse given. You can get compressed gases (CO<sub>2 </sub>and N<sub>2</sub>)
 at the URL at the bottom, and can make arrangements with the same 
company to have them filled with just about anything under the sun 
(including nitrous oxide). Incidentally, you can also order the nitrous 
chargers (boxes of twenty-four) at the same place. Probably a lot 
cheaper than buying them at a head shop, or speciality cooking store.

	I don't know about a tank, but I've thought about just getting a bunch 
of "Whippets," filling a plastic trash bag with them, and sealing my

about $52 for 5 boxes, 24 in each box. Each Whippet is about one 
lungful, so I think 5 boxes would fill a trash bag.

		<br>
		&gt;&gt; <u>expensive</u> kits with a filled 10-lb. bottle by mail order
		<br>
		&gt;&gt; (extra $10.00 UPS hazardous materials fee) and with

		&gt;&gt; a little hunting you might find a mail order

		&gt;&gt; without the associated kit.
		<br>
		&gt;
		<br>
		&gt; I reccomend you all read some of the rec.drugs

		<br>
		&gt; "auto grade" while Whippets and the stuff from

		&gt; the auto stuff has a fair bit of sulphur

		&gt;&gt; Whippets would require a <i>lot</i> of money and a

<p>
	<tt>&nbsp;&gt; What exactly is the nitrogen tent method?</tt>
</p>
<p>
	…You fill an enclosed space with nitrogen and just sit there. The nitrogen displaces the CO<sub>2 </sub>in
 your lungs, preventing you from feeling what you feel when you hold 
your breath for a long time. You simply pass out, and die of 
asphyxiation while you're unconscious. I've heard it's rather pleasant.
</p>
<p>
	Ideally, you should use N<sub>2</sub>0 (Nitrous Oxide) to act as an 
anæsthetic. If you've ever done "Whippits," you'll know what I'm talking
 about. This has been hashed over before, but try to locate surgical 
grade nitrous… The stuff used in Automobiles isn't required to pass 
quality standards for use in humans.
</p>
<p>
	N<sub>2</sub>0 can be purchased in large canisters (by the lb) from welding supply stores and compressed air manufacturers (like <a href="http://www.isi.co.at/main_e.htm">ISI</a>).
</p>
<p>
	While there is nothing illegal about N<sub>2</sub>0, the places that 
sell it know what it can be used for (other than suicide, it can be 
inhaled for a 30 second high.) and hesitate to sell it to residential 
areas. Unless there is a good story involved, that is.

<p>
	<tt>&gt; I'm pretty sure that there's CO<sub>2</sub>in those bottles.</tt>
</p>
<p>
	And I'm pretty sure that you're wrong. I'm sorry, but the "chargers" 
used to fill whipped cream canisters are filled with nitrous oxide. Now,
 the little canisters that work with your air rifle are filled with CO<sub>2</sub>;
 they look alike, but they are filled with different gases. Try inhaling
 the contents of a whipped cream charger sometime and report back to us;
 if it gives you a minute high, then it's N<sub>2</sub>O; if not, it's CO<sub>2</sub>.
 I can tell you right now, though, if you bought it at a cooking supply 
store, for whipping cream utensils, it's filled with nitrous.
</p>
<p>
	Oh, and by the way: don't inhale the gas directly from the chargers; it's compressed, and when it comes out it's <b>very</b> cold. We're talking hypothermia—you might end up freezing a lip off cold.

	High-performance cars use "NO" gas, reffered to as simply "Nitriss" by many of the slack-jawed auto racers.
</p>
<p>
	This is used in conjuction with regular fuel delivery to the carburator
 or fuel injection system. It can only be used in small bursts, 
controlled by the driver.

it's a fertilizer and comes in 50lb. bags. Also available from lab 
supply companies like VW&amp;R or American Scientific at a much greater 
cost.
			</li>
			<li>
				Clean sand. Fairly fine-grained (30 mesh or finer). If you collect 
your and you get fresh water sand, it will be necessary to wash it 
thoroughly with water then dry it before using. You must also wash the 
sand before reusing it.
			</li>
			<li>
				Electric hot plate (500 to 2500 watt) with variable heat.

			<li>
				Stainless steel dial thermometer. (This is the only metal item which
 may be used.) It must go to 250 C (450 F). Select the Erlenmeyer flask 
(next item) and the thermometer so that the thermometer can reach at

		<b>Note:</b> When inserting tubing through stopper holes, <u>always wrap and hold the tubing with a cloth</u>! Also, moisten the tip of the tubing and the stopper hole with glycerin, soap, or spit (though never oil).
		<ol>
			<li>
				Insert the thermometer far enough into the stopper with two holes so
 that when the stopper is put into the Erlenmeyer flask, it almost 
touches the bottom of the flask (but don't allow it to touch), and then 
insert one end of the glass elbow far enough through the stopper so that
 it sticks out 1/4" to 1/2".
			</li>
			<li>
				Into the six one-hole stoppers, insert a piece of the 8mm ID glass 
(or plastic) tubing so that 1/2" to 3/4" protrudes from the narrow end 
of the stopper.
			</li>
			<li>
				Now select your set-up space so that there is 1.5 feet of space 
clear in all directions around the hot-plate, so that the three scrubber
 pipes can lie side by side where they will not be knocked over.
			</li>
			<li>
				Take approximately 2 feet of the 3/8" flexible tubing and connect 
one end to the glass elbow in the two-hole stopper, and the other end to
 the middle of one of the 8mm ID glass (or hard plastic) "T's."
			</li>
			<li>
				With short pieces (select lengths for a neat fit) of 3/8" tubing and
 another 8mm "T" assemble the INLET SET manifold and connect it to the 
bottom end of the scrubbers. Stoppers may then be inserted into the 
lower end of the scrubber pipes.
			</li>
			<li>
				Elevate the OUT end of the scrubber pipes so that the upper end is 
6" to 8" above the IN end, but no more, and then fill the pipes with 
water until they are full within 4" to 8" of the top (outlet) end, and 
insert the outlet stoppers. Try to fill all the scrubbers equally full.
			</li>
			<li>
				With short pieces of 3/8" tubing and two 8mm ID "T's," prepare and 
connect the OUTLET SET manifold to the scrubbers similar to the way the 
set was connected in step 5.
			</li>
			<li>
				To the last "T" of the OUTLET SET (of "T's" manifold), connect a 
fairly long piece of 3/8" tubing to reach a "safe" location (where 
connection and disconnection of the receiver bags will not disturb the 
scrubbers) and secure it. Then put the last piece of 8mm ID hard tubing 
into the free end.
			</li>
			<li>
				Finally, prepare several receiever bags by inserting about an 8" 
piece of tubing into the top so that 3" or 4" sticks out of the bag and 
secure it in place with a rubber band.

		<b>Operation</b>
	</dt>
	<dd>
		First, prepare a quantity of a mixture containing 1/3 sand and 2/3 
ammonium nitrate. Then pour enough of the mixture into the Erlenmeyer 
flask to give 1.5" to 2" in the bottom of the flask. Put the flask onto 
the hot-plate, and insert the two-hole stopper, firmly but not too 
tight.
		<table width="50%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="1" border="1">
			<caption>
				<br>
				<big><b>Warning!</b></big>
			</caption>
			<tbody><tr>
				<td align="justify">
					Once you have started heating the mixture in the Erlenmeyer flask, you <b>must remove</b> the two-holed stopper from the flask <b>before</b>
 turning off the heat. Otherwise, as the flask begins to cool off, it 
will draw water from the scrubbers back into itself, and may crack—or 
even <b>explode</b>—with the steam formed inside.
				</td>
			</tr>
		</tbody></table>
		<p>
			Now you may begin heating the flask. Turn the hot-plate to medium or 
medium-high and watch the thermometer. If the temperature climbs very 
fast, turn the hot-plate down, but be patient about turning it up. 
Occasional bubbles will be noted going through the scrubbers as the air 
in the system expands. At 210°C (410°F) a yellowish to orange-brown will
 begin filling the flask, and the bubbling throught the scrubbers will 
become steady.
		</p>
		<p>
			At this time, adjust the upper end heights of the scrubber tubes so 
that each one gets about the same amount of gas passing through it. Keep
 your eye on the temperature, and it should not climb much over the 
210-220°C (410-430°F) marks. Also the gas at the top of the scrubbers <b>must be perfectly colorless!</b>
 Otherwise, turn down the heat setting. If the gas flow is too low to 
give a steady flow through all three scrubbers, increase the heat 
slightly.
		</p>
		<p>
			Once you've run your system a time or two, you'll know what your operating settings are.
		</p>
		<p>
			As soon as the gas flow is steady and clean, connect a receiving bag

 to add more amonium nitrate-sand mixture to the flask from time to

<p>
	Nitrous oxide actually increases respiratory rate, according to two of 
my resources. Nitrous oxide, administered alone (that is without 
supplemental oxygen) can cause asphyxiation, due to oxygen deprivation. 
This is because the body cannot utilize the oxygen molecule in N<sub>2</sub>O to supply oxygen to the tissues. This lack of oxygen leads to cell death.
</p>
<p>
	As to lethal doses of nitrous oxide… Since it is administered as a gas,
 I'm not sure how one knows that 20mg is actually "solved" into the 
blood. The same applies to the stated "lethal dose" of 60mg. Nitrous 
oxide is administered based on effect in the medical setting. 
Anæsthesiologists do not "dial in" a dose. Everybody responds to 
medications in their own way, so a nonlethal but effective dose for me 
(I weigh about 230 lbs.) could be a lethal dose for a small adult 
weighing, say, 130 lbs.

		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt; Yes, it can actually happen. I have seen a notice
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt; in a Swedish paper about this happening once. I also
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt; think Calle wrote about it in the old methods file.
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt;
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt; What happens is that you upset the osmotic balance
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt; in your system, and your cells in the body will
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt; cease to work, or work a lot less efficiently.
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt;
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt; I do not remember how much water you have to drink,
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt; and during what period of time, but I am sure it is
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt; a considerable amount.
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt;
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt; I would not recommend it though.</tt>
</p>
<p>
	What you are describing is called psychogenic polydipsia which is 
excess water drinking. The chemical change in your blood is a dilutional
 state with a low sodium level (hyponatremia). In order to lower your 
sodium levels critically you must make a massve effort and a poor kidney
 response. The sodium gradient between the brain and blood is such that 
seizures and confusion occurs. Permanent brain damage may follow if you 
don't die.
</p>
<p>
	I feel the risk of suffering during and/or after the attempt is not 
worth it unless you are masochistic and wish to suffer maximally to 
reflect your miserable existence.

	It depends on if you are holding yourself underwater or something else 
is. The context sounds like we're talking about very small bodies of 
water such as a tub. While people do drown in tubs it's usually because 
they are unconscious first (not drunk). If one is serious about 
drowning, though, one should probably choose a much larger water source 
such as a lake or ocean. (Though as Hermotimus has pointed out on 
A.S.H., salt water drowning is more painful.) Then you can either swim 
out (and don't stop—a tough one) until you are so exhausted that you can
 no longer hold your head out of the water. Or bring weights (Virgina 
Woolf put rocks in her pockets) that you can swim with for a while but 
that would sink you if you stopped swimming. Another variation is to 
chose a water source that has a current that will carry you out past the
 point you can return (Pacific Ocean being the prime example out here).

	There are many physical ways of ending one's life. A very limited few include:
</p>
<dl>
	<dt>
		Driving into a Cement Wall
	</dt>
	<dd>
		Depending on the vehicle and the velocity, this may or may not result 
in fatality or immediate termination. I suspect that a motorcycle at 
very high velocity would be the best method of achieving the Motivsplat.
	</dd>
	<dt>
		Touching the "Third Rail"
	</dt>
	<dd>
		Electrocution is uncertain, and could result in some neurological 
problems if we don't succeed in death. I suspect that taking further 
steps, such as anti-insulation, something to do with water, maybe 
carrying big hunks of metal, maybe even transistors or something would 
assist the Jolt. Research into the success of suicidals or accidents 
appears valuable.
	</dd>
	<dt>
		Lying down on Train Tracks
	</dt>
	<dd>
		Stupidity factors here. Advanced timing of the train, which parts of 
the body are cut off (people have become parapalegics but not died in 
such circumstances), whether the suicide is seen (a tunnel would seem 
excellent, or just 'round a bend in the wilderness), who may be nearby, 
whether assistance can really be achieved soon afterward, and whether 
the <i>head</i> is lopped off, would all appear to be factors in the Trainslice.
	</dd>
	<dt>
		Diving off a Tall Structure
	</dt>
	<dd>
		Apparently people have survived, upon occasion, very long plummets. 
sometimes these have been cushioned by foliage or air currents. The 
higher the structure and the more expert the dive (hitting head-first 
can be successful from low-altitudes) are the factors here. Others may 
also be if something is below that might cushion the fall, like trees, 
children, water, etc. Water can be like hitting a wall, at times.

euthanasia, but are adjuncts when used in association with other agents

<p>
	If you're going to step off a chair and strangle yourself to death (sort of quick):
</p>
<blockquote>
	The knot goes behind your neck and should pull tighter as more pressure
 is applied. Loop one end and tie a simple knot with main and looped 
section of rope to make an eye, thread rope through eye, secure to 
something solid. Test the rope. Your unconscious body will thrash about 
as it dies. You may want to put something around the rope where it comes
 into contact with your neck to keep it from cutting. Pull rope tight 
around your neck and step off.
</blockquote>
<p>
	If you're going to try to break your neck (quicker-looking, but arguable whether it's a faster death):
</p>
<p>
	The knot should not pull tight, and be placed behind the ear. It needs 
to go at the side, and you'll need to fall 5-8 feet before it goes tight
 (according to your weight). Someone posted tables here based on weight.
</p>
<p>
	After only a few minutes' worth of web searching (search query was 
"hangman knot"), I found a site that details how to make a noose, at <a href="http://huizen2.dds.nl/~erpprs/kne/noose.htm">Hangman's Noose Knot-Board</a>.

		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt; Check the alt.sex.*bondage groups (as a lurker).

		&nbsp; &gt; Since some of them are into the near-death
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt; asphyxiation/sex thing, they'd have tested the
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt; limits more than ashers would have.
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt;
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt;&gt;&gt; The knot should be at the back of your head,
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt;&gt;&gt; not the side. You can probably do more damage
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt;&gt;&gt; to the brain stem that way. It controls stuff
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt;&gt;&gt; like breathing.
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt;&gt;
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt;&gt;I thought it was more effective if the knot was
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt;&gt;at the side. That the neck would break more
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt;&gt;easily.
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt;
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt; The knot at the side is more effective when you're
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt; out to snap your neck. If you're going for
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt; strangulation instead of breaking the spinal cord,
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt; I'm not sure it matters as much. If you're just
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt; leaning into the noose, having it at the back may
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt; make it easier to apply even pressure to the
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt; windpipe and veins. Being at the back (for
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt; gentle strangulation—if there is such a thing),
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt; wouldn't really cause more physical brain
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt; stem damage. Depending on the knot you use, you
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt; might actually have the least pressure at the knot
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt; point.
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt;
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt; Spinal damage is the main issue in snappings
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt; (long falls). Cutting off the oxygen supply to
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt; the brain is the main issue in strangulations.
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt;
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt; I don't know if taking sedatives or muscle
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt; relaxants significantly cut down on the time to
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt; death for strangulations, but it might cut down
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt; on the thrashing.</tt>
</p>
<p>
	Actually, what the British master hangmen did (after the long-drop 
method was adopted) was to place the knot at the corner of the jaw 
oriented so that as it tightened, it would travel under the the jaw, 
throwing the head back.
</p>
<p>
	They also used a rope with a massive metal ring to aid in throwing back
 the head. The American's used the hangman's knot to do the same thing: 
it was a heavy bulky knot which helped throw the condemned's head back. 
Additionally, it was a high friction knot, so the hangman could tighten 
it and go about the remainder of his business without worrying about the
 noose loostening and coming off. This knot is NOT good for effective 
strangulation precisely for that reason. If the neck is not broken, the 
hangman's knot can actually prolong strangulation because it does not 
tighten very effectively.
</p>
<p>
	Ending up with the knot behind the head throws the head forward and 
virtually guarantees the spine will not be broken unless the drop used 
is extremely long. The knot to the side is a little better.

		The above table shows weight and recommended drop.
	</p>
	<p>
		This is actually a quite important list. Why not give everyone a ten 
foot drop? Turns out that with too much of a drop, if you're too heavy, 
you decapitate yourself, which is both quite messy, and doesn't give the
 right impression. After all, you want to be found hanging there, with 
your suicide note neatly pinned to your chest, or perhaps tastefully 
left on the table beside you, and not with your body in one place and 
your head in another, with a few shards of flesh hanging from the rope. 
Also remember that this was for heavy hanging rope, and that thinner 
rope might not survive the snap at the end of the drop. In other words, 
to do yourself in with your belt, or zipcord, you will have to strangle 
yourself, and not break your neck.
	</p>
	<p>
		Another popular way to kill oneself is with impalement. In the past, 
falling on one's sword was a means of doing this, but these days, a good
 sword is so hard to find, so this method has fallen out of fashion. One
 of my grandmother's roomers did manage to do himself in this way, by 
sitting on an upright vacuum cleaner, and falling backwards onto it, but
 it was never settled as to whether or not this was an intentional 
suicide, or simply a very messy accident during a dangerous sexual 
practice. And do, please, let people know. This fellow was not found for
 three days, and it was quite difficult to get the smell and stains out 
so that the room could be let again.

	<tt>&nbsp;&gt;It's possible to "hang" with both your feet touching
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt;the ground. All that's necessary is pressure on the
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt;neck, cutting off the blood supply to the brain. You
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt;lose consciousness after about 10 seconds. This is
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt;<u>strangulation</u>, not suffocation.</tt>
</p>
<p>
	There are other ways to die by hanging, namely (1) spinal fracture and (2) decapitation, but they're rare in suicide.

		&nbsp;&gt;went to the basement. I tied one end of the cord around
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt;my neck, and pulled the other over a beam in the ceiling.
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt;I stood on the arm of a couch, and pulled the cord until I
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt;was on my tiptoes. Then I stepped off.</tt>
</p>
<p>
	I held the cord tightly. I felt it tighten around my neck (and I hadn't
 even tied any kind of slip knot). I remember just hanging there, 
feeling lightheaded, but not suffering. No pain, just a little 
discomfort. After a few seconds, I tried to breathe. I was able to 
inhale with difficulty, I could hear my rasping breath. Then… nothing.
</p>
<p>
	I came to on the floor I was probably conscious for no more than ten 
seconds, if that long. I had banged my mouth, and cut my lip, but other 
than that, I was fine, though a little dizzy.
</p>
<p>
	Knowing that I will pass out so soon, I will be conscious for no more 
than ten seconds, next time I will tie the cord to the beam.

	You should experience extreme pain, but you will more than likely black
 out before it becomes unbearable. Make sure that the ligature will not 
break or become loose. After you lose consciousness, your body will 
convulse, so it's better not to hang near anything (like I did). You 
need half hour—at least—without interruption, so that you will be dead, 
and not a vegetable, if they try rescuscitation.

	On the contrary, while professional hangmen tried to break the neck,

<p>
	Supposedly, a human head can see for twenty seconds after decapitation.
 And if you were decapitated, don't you think there would be the 
sensation of a "phatom" body, like a tingly sensation around where your 
body was (like "phantom limb pain," where people "feel" pain in limbs 
they've lost)? Let's speculate upon this for a moment: right after the 
sword, guillotine, gear, saw, dashboard, or whatever takes your head 
away, you'd feel a slight sting around the base of your neck, like a 
cut. Then your head would feel light and nauseous. Then possibly you'd 
see stars or black spots in your vision. Sounds would begin to be 
pitched higher. You'd feel coldness around your cheeks and tongue from 
the blood leaving your head. Trying to speak or voice words, your throat
 would be gone, and the only thing coming out of your mouth would be 
blood. Then, slowly creeping into darkness and ice, you would die.

		<br>

		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt; want to go out of your way to go to someplace really cold, what

	Hypothermia doesn't entirely rely only on the air temperature, but also
 on how the body cools! You can sit in icy conditions for ages if youre 
dressed and theres no wind. On the other hand, you will die much more 
quickly on a wet and windy day. Mountain rescue hauls more dead bodyies 
off the hills during wet, stormy days than on cold but clear, sunny 
ones.
</p>
<p>
	Pain penetrates your clothing very quickly when driven by wind; the 
windchill is far more dangerous to you than cold itself. Don't even 
think of just stripping off—your survival instincts will kick in (very 
underestimated and very inconvenient). Go out clothed on a wet and windy
 night in, say, February, 'bout 4 degrees, make sure it's very windy, 
and walk; after a while, you'll feel quiet. Warm, too. So warm, you'll 
want to take your coat off, then you'll want to take a jumper off, after
 a little more time. All the while your body is actually cooling. After 
an hour or so you'll feel tired and you'll want to sit down; shivering 
begins (your body's attempt to generate heat) Tthis is the hardest 
bit—your brain suddenly realises it's cold (last chance to change your 
mind). After that, you'll stop shivering, as your body will have no more
 energy left. You'll feel tired and sleepy, and you'll fall asleep…
</p>
<p>
	If no one finds you, death will occur within a few hours.

</p>
<p>
	Right. To die by hypotermia your body must lose heat at a higher speed 
than he can generate it. Cooling is a heat flux from a warmer system to 
other with a lesser level of heat. When we are talking about hypotermia,
 the warm system is your body, and the cool one is the environ. Three 
main factors determinate the speed of the transference (translating 
directly from the Spanish terms; sorry if they're not exact):
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Heat gradient—The higher the difference in temperature, the faster the transference of heat. <i>("Gradiente de calor.")</i>
	</li>
	<li>
		Heat capacity—Each system can accept a different heat amount. The 
speed at which a system accepts heat depends, as to say, in the "full" 
or "empty" of heat it is. The greater the heat capacity of the receptor,
 the faster the transference. <i>("Capacidad calorífica.")</i>
	</li>
	<li>
		Interchange surface: The greater the exposed surface, the faster the heat transference. <i>("Superficie de intercambio.")</i>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Thus, any circumstance which increases any those factors will accelerate the cooling; for instance:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Windchill—The air hasn't a great heat capacity, but the layer in 
contact with the skin (the interchange surface) is being constantly 
renewed. The faster this is freshening, the greater the apparent heat 
capacity; thus, the faster the cooling.
	</li>
	<li>
		Ambient temperature: The lower the temperature, the greater the heat gradient; thus, the faster the cooling.
	</li>
	<li>
		Coolant—Water has far a bigger heat capacity than air, the heat flux 
"body-&gt;water," or "body-&gt;water-&gt;air," is much faster than 
"body-&gt;air."
	</li>
	<li>
		Clothing—It works stopping the wind. Since the air layer in contact 
with the skin is not renewed, it gets warm fast, and the heat lost goes 
low (there is still heat transference by diffussion, but it is very 
slow).
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	I really don't know how low your temperature must come for you to die. I
 think I heard once something under 32°C (normal body temperature is 
36.5° to 37°C), but I'm not sure. Anyway, how is the mechanism? Heart 
attack? No oxygen in your brain? It is said that if one falls in the 
water in the Arctic ocean, one will die within only a few minutes.
</p>
<p>
	If I were you, I would go with little clothing to a lake in a very cold
 place. Have a bath (dressed) for around two or three minutes to let the
 hypothermia proccess start, and then come out the water and sit in an 
exposed windy place to wait. (Of course, don't dry yourself with a 
towel!)

	Best target is the armpits or femoral arteries get a hollow tube with

<p>
	The keys to wrist slashing are a few things. First, you have to make long and deep cuts; <i>not</i> "across" your wrists, but <i>up your arm</i>—opens
 more of the vein and makes clotting harder. Second, It's best to sit 
and soak in a hot tub of water, or a running shower. The heat and hot 
water will keep your blood flowing and will relax you, but will also 
race your heart, as your body's natural reaction is to pump blood 
faster, to speed your body functions up, to cool your body off. Lastly, a
 little alcohol in your system can't hurt as it also prevents clotting 
of the blood, may stop any anxiety attacks you may have, and may even 
limit the pain. Lastly, elevate your legs while sitting in the tub or 
shower—this will bring the blood from your lower regions back into your 
body's center, where it can get pumped faster, and you may not get as 
light-headed after your bleeding.
</p>
<p>
	Results of a successful wrist-slashing are this: you can expect to get 
cold and feel chilled all over; you will feel groggy soon after losing a
 lot of blood; and you will feel tired. You may feel light-headed, and 
will get sleepy. You will feel your heartbeat throughout your body, and a
 cold, eerie feeling of "pulsation" in your arms and legs, as the hours 
pass and your bloodpressure drops off. Average time to die on a 
wrist-slitting depends on your height, weight, and how large and deep 
the wounds are. Remember: slice <i>up your arm</i> to cut open that 
vein. Average time is at least two to four hours. Maybe longer, if you 
weigh more and have more body mass. Put in a CD, light a candle, drink 
some booze and take some sleep meds. Sit in a hot tub or shower and let 
it all wash away. Hope that answers your questions.

	My mom is an EMT. I asked her about wrist cutting, and she said that cutting across the wrist in <i>not</i>
 going to do it. If you want the wound to stay open, you're much more 
likely to succeed by cutting pretty much along the artery, starting from
 your elbow and working down to the wrist. Another place that is tried a
 lot is the leg—there is an artery on the inside of the leg that is 
bigger than the one in the arms, and probably gets more blood due to the
 greater mass down there. The penis, for males, although painful, would 
be a quite effective way to kill yourself that way. I, myself, wouldn't 
do that for the world, but it's up to you… heh!

stopping the blood flow after a while. Did it again…and again…till I 
finally reached the conclusion that its a louse way to try to take your 
life; it does not work, and I was too weak anyway to be able to do it 
again. So here I am, still alive… First let me mention that I work for a
 rescue service in my free time… didn't try it myself but saw people who
 tried that kind of thing. In reality, it is pretty hard to slash your 
wrists and actually hit an artery. Most people just hit the vein, see a 
splash of blood and think they've hit the artery, and it's done. Wrong. 
First of all, the artery hides <i>below</i> the vein, which pulses 
also—though not as much, so you'd have to keep cutting while the blood's
 gushing—or slash real hard. Second, the artery has to sustain quite a 
high pressure, so it's somewhat more sturdy than a vein. Not too easy to
 cut through. By the time you'd actually get to it, you're probably out 
from loss of blood already. And veins, as you've experienced, have the 
tendency to close off. Even if they didn't, there's always a second way 
of the body protecting itself. It's called centralisation. When this 
happens, the body cuts off nearly all circulation in the arms and legs, 
all the better to provide the vital organs with blood.
</p>
<p>
	So, cutting your wrists is <i>definitively</i> a bad idea. Plus, it 
takes quite some time for you to die, too. Chances are, you'll be 
rescued before there's even a life-threatening situation. And it doesn't
 take much to stop the flow, too, just the touch of a finger… All 
that'll be left is gonna be a long stretch in rehab and very likely some
 psychiatric treatment also… plus a <i>really</i> messy carpet—or wherever you plan to do it—to clean up.
</p>
<p>
	It sure is not as easy to kill one self as it is shown in movies.
</p>
<p>
	Right on… most people fail. Especially if their suicide is more meant to be a scream for help…
</p>
<p>
	Also, many people who try regret it the minute they do… and quite a lot
 of them end up calling for an ambulance themselves… From what I've 
seen, having been through the experience proves to be a healthy shock 
for those who survive—many see the world through different eyes after 
and try to find a new start in life, trying to make it positive and more
 worth living. Sad to hear that this is obviously not so in your case.

	<tt>&nbsp;&gt;where is the best place to aim to cause certain death?
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt;I have heard just below the chin or in the mouth with
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt;gun on an angle pointing to brain or the side of
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt;the head…</tt>
</p>
<p>
	The intuitive answer is go for the eye socket, but just the thought is enough to make most people squirm.
</p>
<p>
	Any bullet "on an angle" or aimed at "the side of the head" is more likely than not to bounce off.
</p>
<p>
	<tt>&nbsp;&gt;what kind of bullet is best?</tt>
</p>
<p>
	A big, heavy, fast one? Stay away from 22 rimfire, the only .22 that 
has any chance of effectiveness is a .223… but IMHO, if you want to save
 money and insure "certain death," find a good (used) double barreled 10
 gauge… Great if you only have to handle the recoil once and don't have 
to worry about having a big black and yellow bruise across your shoulder
 for the next week (voice of experience on that one).
</p>
<p>
	Remember the <a href="http://www.nra.org/rstar/rstargsr.html">NRA's gun-handling rules</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
		<b>Three Fundamental Rules For Safe Gun Handling</b>
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			Always keep the gun pointed in a safe direction.
		</li>
		<li>
			Always keep your finger off the trigger until ready to shoot.
		</li>
		<li>
			Always keep the gun unloaded until ready to use.
		</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		When Using Or Storing A Gun, Always Follow These NRA Rules:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Know your target and what is beyond. Be absolutely sure you have 
identified your target beyond any doubt. Equally important, be aware of 
the area beyond your target. This means observing your prospective area 
of fire before you shoot. Never fire in a direction in which there are 
people or any other potential for mishap. Think first. Shoot second.
		</li>
		<li>
			Be sure the gun is safe to operate. Just like other tools, guns need 
regular maintenance to remain operable. Regular cleaning and proper 
storage are a part of the gun's general upkeep. If there is any question
 concerning a gun's ability to function, a knowledgeable gunsmith should
 look at it.
		</li>
		<li>
			Know how to use the gun safely. Before handling a gun, learn how it 
operates. Know its basic parts, how to safely open and close the action 
and remove any ammunition from the gun or magazine. Remember, a gun's 
mechanical safety device is never foolproof. Nothing can ever replace 
safe gun handling.
		</li>
		<li>
			Use only the correct ammunition for your gun. Only BBs, pellets, 
cartridges or shells designed for a particular gun can be fired safely 
in that gun. Most guns have the ammunition type stamped on the barrel. 
Ammunition can be identified by information printed on the box and 
sometimes stamped on the cartridge. Do not shoot the gun unless you know
 you have the proper ammunition.
		</li>
		<li>
			Wear eye and ear protection as appropriate. Guns are loud and the 
noise can cause hearing damage. They can also emit debris and hot gas 
that could cause eye injury. For these reasons, shooting glasses and 
hearing protectors should be worn by shooters and spectators.
		</li>
		<li>
			Never use alcohol or drugs before or while shooting. Alcohol, as well
 as any other substance likely to impair normal mental or physical 
bodily functions, must not be used before or while handling or shooting 
guns.
		</li>
		<li>
			Be aware that certain types of guns and many shooting activities require additional safety precautions.
		</li>
	</ul>

	The only way to position a <u>handgun</u> to ensure death is to point it directly at a large group of police officers, preferably of a different skin color than yours.
</p>
<p>
	Otherwise, trade it in on a single or double barrel 12-gauge shotgun, 
and spend the extra cash you get from the trade to buy a box of 
double-ought buckshot shells and a cheap hacksaw.

<p>
	The target is your brain stem and not your brain necessarily. Why? 
Because one can survive loss of cerebral cortex but usually with a 
deficit like a stroke. One can not survive loss of the brain stem which 
controls breathing, waking and cardiac function. The good news is that 
enough bleeding in the skull (as long as it remains enclosed) will 
compress the brain stem and squeeze it out at the bottom (uncal 
herniation) and this will kill you (brain death). Enough swelling in the
 brain (cerebral edema) will have the same effect (death). The latter 2 
processes (bleeding and swelling) take time and are potentially 
reversible. The first process namely destruction of the brain stem is 
hopeless or successfull depending upon your perspective.
</p>
<p>
	Now it becomes a simple matter of neuroanatomy to select your spot and 
weapon. I will also base this on being a bad shot as well. If you can 
not control the weapon or pull away or something a grazing injury or 
worse is possible.
</p>
<p>
	This is often seen when the gun is placed in the mouth. Shotgun or not 
(and I believe bullets exist which perform like a shotgun shell), if you
 angle too high into the roof of your mouth you can blast through your 
sinuses and eyes or frontal lobe and survive but virtually destroying 
your face, vision or affect respectively. This is a horrid survival and 
not uncommon. Now if you aim too low, perhaps deep throating the barrel 
you will likely miss the brain altogether and if in the midline transect
 your spinal cord (which could be fatal without intervention) or if to 
the side various airway soft tissue damage.
</p>
<p>
	To sucessfully use your mouth as the entrance wound you must aim up 
toward the brain stem and hopefully blow the back of your skull off. 
This would be 100%. Once again given enough time and inattention any of 
these wounds would be fatal from bleeding, swelling, compression or 
subsequent infection. I vote no for the mouth myself.
</p>
<p>
	The classic temple shot, that is in the mid-skull at eye level is 
stupid. The most damaging brain structures you will hit are the frontal 
lobes. This is tantamount to a frontal lobotomy, but once again given 
enough time… I have heard of shots missing the brain altogether and 
taking out both eyes as well. I vote no for the temple.
</p>
<p>
	How about right in the middle of your forehead to between your eyes. 
This is better if you can hit the midline stuctures such as the midbrain
 and brain stem. I recalled a homeless person firing a nail gun in 
between his eyes with not effect. The nail missed everything and lodged 
in the middle of the brain, so midline brain could be ineffective. I 
vote probable no here too.
</p>
<p>
	So where? My first choice is behind or directly into one ear aiming 
across to the other. With a sure hand the vital brain stem will shread. 
You would not even hear the shot or have time to feel a thing. Likewise 
the barrel directed into either eye socket and aimed down will 
accomplish the task. The neuroanatomical idea is that these sites follow
 the respective cranial nerves (optic, auditory) into vital midline 
structures. I vote yes for this approach.
</p>
<p>
	You can, of course, miss, or pull away, or just be lucky or unlucky 
once again, depending on your perspective. A hand grenade in the mouth 
would be infalllible. One might also consider exploding bullets, etc. (I
 profess a meager knowledge of guns and ammo.)

<p>
	For a shotgun, basically anywhere near your head should do the trick. 
I'd suggest in your open mouth, aiming to go out the top of your head. 
We've all heard the stories of dudes with revolvers shooting into their 
mouths and ending up piercing their neck, with comparitively little 
damage.
</p>
<p>
	For a shotgun, I'd suggest placing the "butt" of it on the ground, 
against a wall, then sit/kneel in front of it with the barrel in your 
mouth. This last part should avoid it kicking and you not "finishing the
 job."
</p>
<p>
	After the job's done, you'll be left with half a head (at best), and a <i>lot</i>
 of mess around. A lot of people don't want this, so be warned. Your 
body will tend to fall backward rather than foward (because of the 
wall).

<p>
	You can generally find a youth-model 12-gauge shotgun at your local 
sporting goods store for around $80. I saw one for $71, and you only 
need to be 18—there is no waiting period.
</p>
<p>
	Buy 00 ("double-aught") buckshot shells for it and you're ready. You 
might want to securely duct-tape it to your head so it's in your mouth 
and there is no possibility of simply blowing part of your face off.
</p>
<p>
	I can't think of much that's more certain short of using a grenade for a
 pillow. You won't even hear the blast. If your arms are short, use your
 toe for the trigger.

		&nbsp;&gt;&gt;&nbsp; head…

</p>
<p>
	The articles I read said that the Cobains kept a shotgun loaded with 
"light target loads" around in case of intruders, the idea being that if
 fired in the house, the lighter load of the smaller shots would not 
penetrate completely through a drywall wall… the idea, ironically, was <i>safety.</i>

		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt;Anybody here an expert?</tt>
</p>
<p>
	The difference between a 12-gauge and a 20-gauge is that the shell for 
the 12 is bigger, and is generally "more powerful." This means that for a
 given shot size (say, BB) there are more pellets in a 12-gauge, and the
 round can have more powder, so they travel faster.
</p>
<p>
	However, the bigger 12-gauge shotgun also weighs more, and recoil may 
be heavier. The 16-gauge is a nice compromise between the two.
</p>
<p>
	<tt>&nbsp;&gt;(Of which I am definitely not one, obviously.)</tt>
</p>
<p>
	Probably the "best choice" would be a double barrelled shotgun of whatever caliber you feel most comfortable with.

<p>
	<tt>
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt; I am fuzzy on the definition of "gauge," but it is, I think, some kind of metal
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt; worker's size scale. (As railroad tracks, for instance, are said to be of
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt; this or that "gauge" in reference to how far apart they are, etc.) I don't
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt; <i>think</i> it has anything to do with weight, etc. More some type of measurement
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt; of distance or size.
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt;
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt; As for the pellets that make up the shotgun shell, any type pellet load can be
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt; in any type shotgun gauge. (Again, AFAIK. Probably the tiny .410 shotgun
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt; can't fit the really big 00 buckshot shells, as they could probably only
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt; contain 1 or 2 pellets then!)
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt;
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt; Pellets go from 00 to 0 to 1, 2, 3, etc., up to 10, I think; possibly even 12.
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt; Again, and confusingly, the <i>lower</i> the number, the <i>bigger</i> the pellet
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt; size. So, logically, a 12-gauge #0 shell would have more pellets in it than a
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt; 20-gauge #0 shell, just 'cuz it's bigger, so you were correct on that. <i>However,</i>
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt; the actual <i>size</i> of the pellets is the same if they're #00, #4, or whatever,
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt; regardless of what gauge shell they're in. Did I make sense?</tt>

	For crying out loud! Use the 9mm! The .32 auto-cartridge is notoriously

<p>
	Yes, recoil does matter even in that short period of time. I've handled
 .38 semi-automatics with just a four-inch barrel and have gone all over
 the place on a bullseye because the recoil was so intense. And, in the 
extreme case, there was a terrible incident that happened here in my 
town about six months ago, where a woman who was training at a firing 
range experienced a recoil so powerful that she killed somebody by 
actually having her hands with the gun whip over and behind her head.
</p>
<p>
	However, I will concede that putting the barrel of the gun in the mouth
 would palliate the problems of recoil but I was envisioning a 
single-handed shot with the muzzle placed at the side of the head. If I 
did such a maneuver with a .44 Magnum, whatever the barrel size, I'd 
totally miss my head and probably kill somebody, too, as that 
unfortunate woman did.

		Choose one 9mm semi-auto handgun—9mm isn't really necessary, but I'm trying to stick to your preferences.
	</li>
	<li>
		Undergo background check, and, if your state of residence is one of the "waiting-period" states, wait seven to fifteen days.
	</li>
	<li>
		If you have a documented history of drug abuse, a felony record, a 
history of inpatient treatment for mental illness (since 1985, I 
believe), are currently on release awaiting trial, have been convicted 
of the misdemeanor of domestic assault, (I believe) are named in a 
restraining order, or are under the age of 21, forget about buying the 
gun.
	</li>
	<li>
		If you're not a known drug-abuser, nor do you fall under any of the 
other restricted categories, you can come back in one to two weeks to 
pick up your gun. Be prepared to spend several hundred dollars if you 
want to ensure that you have a high-quality gun which won't misfire or 
jam.
	</li>
	<li>
		Purchase one package of 9mm-Luger Glaser Safety Slugs (wouldn't want 
to kill anyone else in the process, through overpenetration, would we?).
 Remember to bring your I.D. for this—in many states you can't purchase 
handgun ammunition unless you're over 21 years of age.
	</li>
	<li>
		Go home.

	<li>
		Write Last Will and Testament.

		Make sure cat has enough food and water.

		Pinch back slide and insert one Glaser Safety Slug (rounded end goes 
toward the front). Release slide. You may have to whack the slide with 
the heel of your hand in order to get the round to seat properly.
	</li>
	<li>
		Set rest of package of ammunition aside—you won't be needing it, and 
you don't want to leave a loaded gun unattended after your death.
	</li>
	<li>
		Insert empty magazine—I do believe there are some guns which won't 
fire if the magazine is not inserted. Make sure it is properly placed by
 driving home with heel of weak hand.

	<li>

<p>
	Okay—any mechanical engineers or gunsmiths in the house?
</p>
<p>
	A shotgun, stripped of the need to fire multiple rounds, of the need 
for accuracy, comfort, or anything else besides launching a handful of 
00 buckshot at the base of your skull once, is an incredibly simple 
thing—really just a pipe of sufficient strength and the right size and a
 firing mechanism, which need only strike the center of the shell one 
time with a modicum of force.
</p>
<p>
	Imagine: the 12-gauge, single shot, single use zip gun. Constructed 
from $20 worth of hardware that requires no ID to buy, you need only 
supply the shotgun shell. (Which, sadly, will require ID in the US, but 
only showing you are over 18, and with no waiting period applicable.)
</p>
<p>
	Wondering how cheap and simple-to-make such a thing could be… maybe I will pursue this idea.
</p>
<p>
	Hrm, preliminary idea—
</p>
<p>
	A pipe of just the right size so that, as in the barrel of a gun, the 
plastic part of the shell will fit inside the pipe, but the metal lip on
 the shell will prevent the shell from falling into the barrel; have a 
shell so affixed to it (and epoxied into place so it cannot fall out of 
the barrel, either) with a BB taped to the place the firing pin would 
strike on the metal end of the shell, and place that inside another pipe
 just large enough that the first pipe can freely move through the 
larger pipe.
</p>
<p>
	Now, the end of the large pipe can be held in one's mouth as one kneels
 on the floor over the device, and the small pipe is allowed to drop 
through the large pipe so that the shell with the BB taped to the firing
 point strikes a hard concrete floor while the other end of the small 
pipe is still inside the larger pipe.
</p>
<p>
	Doable?
</p>
<pre>An ASCII art attempt follows:

|     |
|     | &lt;- inner pipe
|     |
|     |
||---||
||   ||
||   || &lt;- shell inside inner pipe
||___||
||   ||
||   ||
---o---  &lt;- the lip of the metal part of the shell, and the BB, taped to the point the firing pin would strike</pre>
<p>
	Drop this through a larger pipe so the BB hits the ground while the 
small pipe is still partially in the large pipe, with your mouth around 
the top of the big pipe.
</p>
<p>
	Ideally one would just buy a shotgun, but not everyone is so fortunate as to be legally able to.

	If the idea of pain is unbearable, you might want to go to a building 
supply store to purchase a Remington Model 490 nail gun, a pack of 
one-inch-long nails, and a package of heavy duty .22-caliber power 
loads. You could then go to a sporting-goods store to purchase a box of 
.32- caliber ammunition. First, load a .22-caliber power load into the 
breach of the nail gun. Second, load a nail into the muzzle of the nail 
gun. Third, load a .32-caliber cartridge into the muzzle of the nail 
gun. Fourth, press the muzzle of the nail gun firmly against the side of
 your head in order to compress the firing pin spring. Finally, pull the
 trigger. The firing pin will detonate the .22-caliber power load, which
 will drive the point of the nail into the primer of the .32-caliber 
cartridge, which causes the .32-caliber bullet to be ejected from the 
gun and into your head.

	<tt>&nbsp; &gt;&gt; Jumping in front of trains seems to be pretty
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt;&gt; reliable here. Over the span of just three
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt;&gt; months, between Tachikawa and Kichijoji on the
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt;&gt; Chuo line (a very small section of that line),
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt;&gt; we had seventeen "jumpers" in 1995.
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt;&gt;
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt;&gt; In those cases the family must pay huge fines
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt;&gt; according to how long the trains are down for
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt;&gt; maintainance and clean-up after the suicide, so
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt;&gt; it punishes and shames the family quite
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt;&gt; effectively. It's not very Kevorkian.
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt;
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt; Are you serious? The families have to pay?
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt; Why? How are <i>they</i> deemed responsible when
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt; often its just society-at-large that pushes one
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt; "over the edge"? I don't understand the
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt; justification here… wow… families paying
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt; for how long commuters are inconvenienced…
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt; that's both hilarious and frightening.</tt>
</p>
<p>
	It is true and it has also been very effective in reducing the number 
of train jumpers. From the Japanese government standpoint, one "jumper" 
during rush hour has an economic cost of millions. hundreds of dollars 
every year can have a real impact. The point of the legislation was to 
try to control the method of choice more than it was to stop suicides or
 punish families. Even so when the head of the oil cleanup from the 
northern oil spill "felt" in front of a train, it was reported as an 
accident. Maybe they did not fine his family.

when underwater (say, with weights attached to ankles). it requires an 
iron will and a supreme display of self-control that overcomes autonomic
 self-rescue responses. this is why depressants are used in

		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt;&gt; and relax the muscles.
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt;&gt;
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt;&gt; Then I will enjoy about one and a half-liter of Vodka
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt;&gt; (according to the post on lethal overdose I will need
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt;&gt; roundabout that).
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt;&gt;
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt;&gt; To finish it all off I will use the band and bag
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt;&gt; method.
		<br>
		&nbsp;&gt;
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt;That combination is kinda difficult—you may find that
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt;you'll be too out of it all of a sudden (in my case it
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt;unexpectedly hit me—not sure what happened afterwards
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt;and when people told me about it it didn't seem at all
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt;familiar… I was unable to recognise anyone and had to
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt;ask who people were every two minutes or so). Then
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt;there is always the problem of holding it all down…
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt;1,5l of vodka is fine, but the problem is drinking
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt;it all! Not sure I could. Not without being violently
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt;sick after the first .75 l anyway!</tt>
</p>
<p>
	The violent sickness probably begins hours later (when most of the 
alcohol hopefully has left the stomach…) but unfortunately the narcotic 
effect sets in very soon and makes it impossible to use bag and band 
properly. After taking the valium and drinking half the quantity you'll 
be half unconscious.
</p>
<p>
	I would feel much more secure if I could combine it with a situation 
that ensures death in any case, i.e. to drink myself silly in a leaking 
boat in a cold night is really a tempting idea to me.
</p>
<p>
	Another (stupid or not?) variant is to stand with the noose around your
 neck and instead of kicking the chair (on which you stand) off and to 
keep drinking until you collapse.

	<tt>&nbsp; &gt;&gt; If I were to take enough sleeping pills and
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt;&gt; then put a plastic bag over my head while
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt;&gt; I'm drifting off to sleep, would the sleeping
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt;&gt; pills ensure that I wouldn't wake up once
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt;&gt; their isn't enough oxygen in the bag? I
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt;&gt; don't want to take enough sleeping pills to
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt;&gt; kill me, just enough so that I could sleep
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt;&gt; through the suffocation. Thanks.
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt;
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt;This is the exact method I tried—two problems
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt;arose: first time round, I waited for about
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt;twenty minutes for the sleepers (Temazepam) to
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt;reach maximum effect, and accidentaly fell
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt;asleep for four hours. I then topped them off
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt;with a couple more, then tried the plastic bag,
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt;but even though I was drowsy, I still managed
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt;to panic and get up enough adrenaline to partly
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt;rip the bag off my head (it was tied on with a
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt;length of rope round the neck), whereupon I fell
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt;unconscious and was discovered by a guy walking
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt;his dog and taken to hospital.
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt;
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt;I believe the method's sound—just needs a
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt;little reworking…</tt>
</p>
<p>
	It's nice to hear other's attempt at this particular method (my 
favorite method). Just today I saw someone on tv who died from this 
method (read "Suicide on LAPD show" for details). My problems were about
 the same as yours regarding the panic. Though drugged with 
diphenhydramine and vodka, I couldn't help but pull the rubber band from
 my neck…

<p>
	<tt>&nbsp; &gt;&gt; I have actually taken about 30 OTC's tablets before
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt;&gt; (not sure what kind). I fell asleep for a long time
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt;&gt; and then I woke up and found out I was starving so
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt;&gt; I ate some food and got right back to sleep. I had
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt;&gt; a weird sensation in my head that would make me
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt;&gt; feel sleepy so I slept a lot for the rest of the
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt;&gt; week or so. Generally I believe OTC's along won't work.
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt;&gt; My next attempt will pobably be OTC's + bag/band +
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt;&gt; alchohol. Hope this helps.
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt; Thank you for the input! My plan is exactly OTC's + bag
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt; and band + alchohol.
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt;
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt; I have the following question for you, and please make
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt; your best guess according to your experience: is
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt; deep-sleep induced by a high doesage of OTC's sufficient
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt; to avoid panic reaction to the "bag and band" method?
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt;
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt; I fear that if the deep-sleep is not deep enough, my
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt; reflexes might do something like ripping the bag open
		<br>
		&nbsp; &gt; and such.</tt>
</p>
<p>
	Believe it or not, I just tried OTC's + bag and band + alchohol not 
very long ago and failed. OTC's is simply not strong enough and fast 
enough. I can not fell asleep for two reasons: the uncomfortableness 
caused by putting the bag on me, and the urge to vomit.
</p>
<p>
	It is not only when I rip the bag open and waited for the feeling of 
throwing up to go away did I fell asleep. I could have taken more dosage
 and drink more alchohol but I doubt I can hold it down all in my 
stomach that way. I have to disgard this method and go for others.

<p>
	Well-said… OTC's don't work well with the bag because even though they 
are sedatives they aren't strong enough to suppress your response to CO<sub>2</sub>build-up
 in the bag. Even benzodiazepines like halcion, restoril, valium etc 
don't really work well with the bag for the same reason… unless you take
 a massive dose accompanied by lots of booze. Benzos(and alcohol of 
course) also have a tendency to produce nausea in overdose. The meds 
that work best with the bag are the barbiturates (secobarbital, 
pentobarbital, phenobarbital, etc) because they do directly suppress 
your brain's response to CO<sub>2</sub>. They are also less likely to induce nausea/vomiting.

<p>
	I've come across very few suicides that have succeeded this way, but 
have found more than a few notable stories of suicidal types who have 
tried this method and blown the fuses…
</p>
<p>
	Factory worker Peter Ditert was a German case of repeated serious 
attempts, last time I read he had notched up number 10 after being 
discovered after an OD on 60 unspecified sleeping pills. Other attempts 
include—rat poison (puked), gunshot to head (gun jammed), and the 
hair-drier in the bath method in question. It blew the fuse…
</p>
<p>
	Then there's 46-year-old Alan Unwin, an ex-miner from Sunderland, U.K. 
He tried to kill himself seven times after his wife left him, including 
the "shake hands with Jesus" method—he wrapped himself in wire and 
jumped in the tub before plugging in. The fuse blew and he suffered 
minor electric shock. Most drastic, by the way, was his sixth attempt, 
where he broke a gas pipe in his bedroom and lay down, waiting for 
death. Fed up of waiting, he lit a match… this blew out all the windows,
 part of the roof and the gable end of his house. He was pulled from the
 wreckage with minor flash burns… a year later he was a much more 
cheerful man and back on speaking terms with his estranged wife! Go 
figure…

	I think the use of a handgun while standing in water is a method that 
should be considered. It increases the probability that the desired 
result will be acheived. A shot to the head is not always effective, but
 if done in water where no one is close by, the result would be almost 
certain.

			Based on my knowledge of this method, injecting air into a vein or 
artery (I think it's the vein, because it gets to the heart sooner) 
causes a heart attack. Therefore, as noted already, it'd hurt like hell.
 Aside from that, I know nothing.

		</p>
		<p>
			Here is the info from Section III—Health Information on LP Gas, which
 is not natural gas. If you house has tanks, it is LP Gas. If there is 
no tank anywhere outside, it is most likely natural gas.
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			<b>Inhalation:</b> Asphyxiant in high concentrations due to dillution
 of available oxygen. At excessive vapor concentrations, this product 
has anæsthetic, asphyxiating properties and may cause sleepiness. At 
levels above 100,000 ppm, propane is mildly irritating to the 
respiratory tract and may result in dizziness, headache, drowsiness, 
nausea, shortness of breath, muscular incoordination, excessive 
salivation, disorientation, vomiting, and excitation. In extreme cases, 
convulsions, unconsciousness and death may occur as a result of 
asphyxiation.
		</blockquote>
		<p>
			Most home LP gas stoves have a gas regulator that will not open the 
gas valve unless the pilot light is lit. If the pilot is lit and gas 
begins flowing it automatically ignites. If the pilot is not lit, gas 
won't flow out. It is a safety catch-22 that reduces the possibility for
 a house filling with gas if the knob is turned on.
		</p>
		<p>
			Propane (LP gas) freezes when it is allowed to escape quickly and 
become a vapor (released from its tank). If you tried to re-route the 
gas line into yourself, you would be horribly burned by super-cold 
temperatures. Gas regulators allow it to escape slowly enough under a 
few pounds of pressure so that the jet doesn't ice up.
		</p>
		<p>
			At least this is my rudimentary knowledge and experience with it.
		</p>
		<p>
			I recommend abandoning that idea.

	I read it out of sheer curiosity… interesting book and a great intro 
for people looking for a way out. But most will find it disappointing 
because it tells you what you should take but doesn't give concrete 
advice on how to get it. It is also gives very inconsistent advice on 
dosages, among other things. But who said suicide is an exact science? I
 recommend <i>Departing Drugs,</i> a much better and more accurate book,
 which is also based on ongoing research. You have to be a member of a 
Right-to-Die organization to get it, though.
